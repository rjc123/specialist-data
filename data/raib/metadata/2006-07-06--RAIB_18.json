    "Summary:": "On Thursday 06 July a tram was traversing hand points at Blackpool Pleasure Beach at less than 4mph when it became derailed. There were no injuries and only minor marking to the switch tips and the surrounding concrete as a consequence of the incident.\r\r\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the trailing wheelsets travelling onto the wrong line, after the leading wheelset had correctly travelled onto the normal route.\r\r\nA causal factor was that the hand points mechanism had not been correctly returned to the normal position before the passage of the tram, and there were three contributory factors.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations to Blackpool Transport Services as a result of its investigation, covering procedures and training for the operation of handpoints."
