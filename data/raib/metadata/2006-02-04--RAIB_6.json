    "Summary:": "On Saturday 4th February a steam locomotive was travelling at low speed towards Loughborough Central station when it collided with the rearmost of six carriages berthed at platform 1. Two members of GCR staff sustained minor injuries. The locomotive and one carriage sustained damage.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe immediate cause of the collision was that the driver did not apply the locomotive break. Factors that contributed to the incident were the driver and fireman being distracted from looking out, reduced visibility due to a concentration of steam, and the driver's reduced visual acuity when not wearing spectacles.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB has made four recommendations to Great Central Railways as a result of its investigation. They cover:\r\r\n\r\r\nrevising its Rule Book and training\r\r\nensuring members of staff comply with the requirements of their medical certificates\r\r\nensuring its policy on medical certification and recertification is properly applied\r\r\nensuring a first aid kit is provided and clearly indicated in all locomotive cabs"
