    "Summary:": "On Thursday 12 January 2006 the 02:40 Thameslink service from Bedford to Brighton experienced difficulties when braking for the scheduled stop at Haywards Heath and over-ran the station by approximately 4 vehicle lengths. The train was set back into Haywards Heath and similar braking difficulties were experienced during this move. The train was terminated at Haywards Heath.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe immediate cause of the incident was the presence of an extraneous washer in the drumswitch, causing an electrical defect preventing the proper application of the brakes.
