    "Summary:": "At 1:30am on 5 December 2007, a road-rail vehicle (RRV) hauling a loaded trailer was unable to stop as it approached a work site where rock face repairs were taking place. Several site staff narrowly avoided injury by jumping clear. Although a low-speed collision occurred between the RRV and another RRV at the site, staff were not injured.\r\r\nThe RAIB investigation identified a number of immediate causal factors:\r\r\n\r\r\n    the RRV\u2019s trailer was not fitted with brakes adequate to stop it on the gradient\u00a0\r\r\n    there were poor weather conditions; and\u00a0\r\r\n    it was likely there were wood chippings on the track.\u00a0\r\r\n\r\r\nThere were also a number of contributory factors, including:\r\r\n\r\r\n    Network Rail did not advise their contractor of the gradient at the site;\u00a0\r\r\n    the machine operator was not aware of the risk of rail contamination from other work going on at the site;\u00a0\r\r\n    the machine was travelling too fast;\u00a0\r\r\n    the road tyres of the vehicle were not inflated to the correct pressure; and\u00a0\r\r\n    the operator\u2019s training did not cover how to deal with a braking emergency.\r\r\n\r\r\nAs a consequence of this incident, the RAIB has made seven recommendations targeted at Network Rail and the companies who own or operate road-rail vehicles. These include:\r\r\n\r\r\n    providing briefing information for road-rail vehicle operators\u00a0\r\r\n    putting in place competence systems and management for road-rail vehicle operators\u00a0\r\r\n    the provision of a risk assessment for RRVs\u00a0\r\r\n    the provision of service brakes on road-rail vehicle trailers"
