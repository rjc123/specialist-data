    "Summary:": "During the evening of 28 November 2009, a London to Yeovil train ran into a landslip in a cutting on the eastern approach to Gillingham tunnel in Dorset. The leading carriage of the train became derailed and the train ran into the tunnel and stopped 200 metres inside. The landslip was caused by water overflowing from a blocked ditch at the top of the cutting slope. Two passengers reported minor injuries and the leading carriage of the train and around 450 metres of railway track were damaged. \r\r\nThe immediate cause of the accident was a landslip triggered by water overflowing from a blocked ditch.\r\r\nThe causal factors were: the Victorian cutting design did not take adequate account of the interaction between geology, groundwater and heavy rainfall; roots were not dealt with properly during maintenance work and the person who inspected the ditch did not have appropriate guidance about how to deal with roots; there was no Network Rail process for establishing the drainage ditch condition; and there had been a lack of action in response to an earlier memorandum.\r\r\nThe RAIB have made five recommendations to Network Rail relating to management of drainage and earthworks.\u00a0 These include a recommendation to identify, and then adequately maintain, drainage which is required for railway safety but is not located close to the railway tracks."
