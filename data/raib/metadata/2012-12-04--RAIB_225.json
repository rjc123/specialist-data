    "Summary:": "At 12:31 hrs on Tuesday 4 December 2012 a collision occurred between a passenger train and a car at Beech Hill automatic half barrier (AHB) level crossing near Finningley, on the line between Gainsborough and Doncaster. One of the occupants of the car, a young child, was seriously injured in the collision and later died in hospital.\r\r\nThe train involved was operated by East Midlands Trains. It consisted of a single carriage unit and was travelling at 60 mph (96 km/h) at the time of the collision. None of the 20 passengers and two crew members on the train was injured in the accident.  Equipment beneath the train was damaged in the collision leading to the spillage of diesel fuel from the train\u2019s fuel tank, but there was no fire.\r\r\nThe level crossing was owned and maintained by Network Rail and was fitted with a data logger which showed that the crossing was operating normally at the time of the accident, with the barriers down as the car approached. The car driver stated that she did not see that the road traffic light signals (known as wig-wags) were flashing as she approached and only noticed the lights and barriers when she was very close to the crossing. The weather was sunny at the time of the collision but there had been rain showers earlier and the road surface was wet, leading to glare from the low winter sun.\r\r\nThe RAIB took the wig-wag units and arranged for testing in an optical laboratory. It was found that they were fitted with 36 W lamps and an obsolete design of red lens unit. Their light output was measured to be well below the specification for lights of  this type. Network Rail had no plans in place to replace the light units with brighter ones and had no process to identify that such replacement was necessary.\r\r\nThe RAIB has made four recommendations as follows:\r\r\n\r\r\n    infrastructure managers to determine which level crossings are fitted with 36 W  lamps and draw up plans for their replacement with LED units;\r\r\n    infrastructure managers to devise a method of assessing the risk of a bright  background and glare preventing wig-wag signals from being seen and propose  means of mitigating this;\r\r\n    infrastructure managers to introduce a new \u2018brighter\u2019 type of LED wig-wag for use at  sites where sunlight glare has been identified as a problem; and\r\r\n    infrastructure managers to enhance the inspection and maintenance process for  wig-wag lamps."
