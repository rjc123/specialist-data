    "Summary:": "On Saturday 4 July 2009 a freight container train was travelling from Grangemouth, Scotland to Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal when two container doors came open and struck three passenger trains on the West Coast Main Line between 16:02 hrs and 16:27 hours. There were no casualties as a result of the collision however the container doors and the passenger trains were damaged.\r\r\nThe container doors had come open without being identified.  The evidence indicates that it is most likely that the doors came open as a result of criminal action.\r\r\nThe collisions with the passenger trains occurred because there was no feature on the container or wagon to prevent open container doors from going out of the allowable space envelope for loads carried on the railway.\r\r\nAs a consequence of this accident, the RAIB has made three recommendations targeted at freight operating companies.  These cover the following areas:\r\r\n\r\r\n    changing the types of security seal to reduce the risk of container doors being opened; and\u00a0\r\r\n    introducing measures to prevent open doors going out of the allowed space envelope."
