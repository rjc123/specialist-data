    "Summary:": "The report into a fire on a freight shuttle train in the Channel Tunnel on 11 September 2008 has been released.  The report was prepared jointly by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) in the UK and their counterparts in France, the Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates sur les Accidents de Transport Terrestre (BEA-TT).\r\r\n\r\r\nThe investigation was led by BEA-TT because the fire occurred on French territory (approximately 12 kilometres from the French portal of the tunnel).  The \u2018Protocol of Cooperation\u2019 between BEA-TT and RAIB allocates responsibility for leading an investigation to the organisation from the country in which the accident or incident occurred."
