    "Summary:": "At 17:58 hrs on Thursday 18 December 2008 a train struck an unoccupied car, derailed, and came to a stop as a train passed in the opposite direction. The passing train struck debris from the collision before it braked to a stop. There were no injuries as a consequence of the accident.\r\r\nThe RAIB investigation found that the collision occurred because:\r\r\n\r\r\n    the car had rolled onto the railway from a car park after being left inadequately braked on a gradient (the car park is owned by UPS, a package delivery company);\u00a0\r\r\n    the car park fence was neither designed nor able to prevent the car\u2019s incursion;\r\r\n    the railway controller was not alerted to the presence of the car on the track in time to stop trains;\r\r\n    Network Rail had not considered the risk of vehicle incursion from adjoining private land; and\u00a0\r\r\n    UPS had not identified the risk of vehicle incursion onto the railway from its car park.\r\r\n\r\r\nAs a consequence of this accident, the RAIB has targeted two recommendations at Network Rail and one at UPS. The recommendations cover:\r\r\n\r\r\n    provisions for UPS to inform Network Rail immediately a road vehicle enters the railway;\u00a0\r\r\n    improving the boundary of the UPS car park to reduce the likelihood and consequences of incursion onto the railway; and\u00a0\r\r\n    identifying and improving those sites where the risk of incursion from private land is highest."
