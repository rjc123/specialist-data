    "Summary:": "On Thursday 16 November 2006 an engineer's train carrying out a shunting movement entered platform 2 at Swanage and collided with a rake of carriages that were stabled there. Two members of Swanage Railway personnel were injured, though neither required hospital treatment. The locomotive and one carriage sustained damage to the buffers and surrounding bodywork.\r\r\nThe immediate cause of the collision was that the locomotive driver did not register the signalled route of the train when he checked the signal before starting the train move. There was one causal factor and two contributory factors to the incident, plus three observations regarding the operational safety of the Swanage Railway that did not contribute to the collision.\r\r\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations as a result of their investigation, and three recommendations to address other matters observed during the investigation. These are aimed at:\r\r\n\r\r\n    amending the Swanage Railway Rule Book;\u00a0\r\r\n    improving safety critical communication;\u00a0\r\r\n    medical standards for drivers;\u00a0\r\r\n    improving the safety of staff; and\u00a0\r\r\n    illuminating vehicles when stabled in Swanage platform."
