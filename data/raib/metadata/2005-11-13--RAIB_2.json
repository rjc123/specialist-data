    "Summary:": "This report describes the RAIB\u2019s investigation of the collision between a passenger train and a car at Swainsthorpe level crossing, near Norwich, on 13 November 2005. Regrettably, the driver of the car was killed. The train was not derailed and none of the passengers or traincrew was injured.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB investigated the performance of the level crossing equipment and the crash worthiness and fire resistance of the train as it became apparent early in the investigation that the car was driven onto the level crossing after the road traffic light signals had been seen to start flashing and the crossing booms had lowered. The reasons why the car was driven onto the crossing are outside the scope of the RAIB\u2019s investigation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe driving and maintenance of the train and the operation of the level crossing did not contribute to the collision. There was no action that the train driver could have taken to prevent the collision occurring. The train performed well in the areas of both crash worthiness and fire performance.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB makes no recommendations as a result of its investigation."
