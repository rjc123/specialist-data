    "Summary:": "On Monday 17 July 2006 a shunter employed by Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd was crushed between a locomotive and a wagon during a shunting move at Dagenham Dock yard. There were no immediate witnesses.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe shunter sustained fatal injuries when he fell between the buffers of the locomotive and the wagon. He had been standing or walking close to the train alongside a siding, and as the train passed he collapsed or tripped, and so fell into the gap between the buffers. If the shunter tripped, a causal factor was the damaged condition of the trackside walkway, which presented a hazard. There were also seven contributory factors.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB has made seven recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at:\r\r\n\r\r\nthe management of identified risks;\r\r\nensuring compliance with the rule book;\r\r\nmethods of working; and\r\r\nthe establishment of safe walking routes."
