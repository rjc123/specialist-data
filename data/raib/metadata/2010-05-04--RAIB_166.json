    "Summary:": "A derailment occurred on the night of 3/4 May 2010 at Ashburys in Manchester. Five wagons loaded with aggregate ran away from a siding for 890 metres before two of them were derailed at trap points. The wagons had been left in the siding three days earlier. \r\r\nThe runaway was caused by ineffective handbrakes on the wagons. The investigation found deficiencies in the maintenance plan for the wagons and raised a concern about the way in which safety related information from other industries was brought to the attention of the rail industry.\r\r\nThe RAIB has made six recommendations, relating to operating instructions, maintenance plans, distribution of safety related information from other industries and improved brake testing."
