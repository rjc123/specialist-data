    "Summary:": "On Sunday 18 March 2007 a tram was approaching Seaton station on the Seaton tramway when it derailed at the points at the entry to the station. There were no injuries as a result of the incident.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the left hand switch of the point lying open, possibly caused by unknown persons placing an object in the points. Contributory factors were a lack of visual indication to the driver of the position of the points, and the design of the points.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations aimed at:\r\r\nthe design of the point lever at Seaton station; and\r\r\nthe provision of visual indicators for drivers on the position of the points."
