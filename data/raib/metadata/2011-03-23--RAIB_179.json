    "Report name:": "111215_R202011_Lydney", 
    "Summary:": "At approximately 14:24 hrs on Wednesday 23 March 2011, train number 1M68, the 13:45 hrs service from Cardiff to Nottingham, passed over Lydney manually controlled barrier (MCB) level crossing while the barriers were in the raised position. This \r\r\ncrossing is on the main line between Gloucester and Newport. The railway signal protecting the level crossing was showing green, and the train was travelling at 59 mph (94 km/h). The red flashing lights intended to instruct road users to stop were operating and there were no road vehicles on the crossing. No injuries or damage \r\r\nresulted from the incident.\r\r\nThe crossing keeper had raised the up side barrier manually during the 90 minutes before the incident, due to a defect in the equipment controlling the barrier motors. Shortly before the incident, the crossing keeper lowered the barriers for a train \r\r\napproaching from the direction of Gloucester. He then raised both barriers manually just before the Cardiff to Nottingham train arrived at the crossing. An annunciator (buzzer) intended to warn the crossing keeper about approaching trains did not give the usual warning.\r\r\nThe railway signals protecting Lydney crossing should have been placed at danger before the barriers could be raised safely. The crossing keeper had no facility to control these signals, and did not inform signallers at Newport who could have kept the signals at danger while the barriers were raised. Several possible reasons for not informing the signaller have been identified. \r\r\nThe RAIB has made recommendations to Network Rail relating to the adequacy of instructions and training given to crossing keepers and signallers; and, the process used for on-going assessment of staff competencies. The RAIB has also recommended that Network Rail should modify standards for new and upgraded \r\r\ncrossings so that protecting signals always display a stop aspect when the crossing barriers are raised."
