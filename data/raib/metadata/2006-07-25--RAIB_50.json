    "Summary:": "On Tuesday 25 July 2006 the leading bogie of the 10:50 Mid Hants Railway service from Alton to Alresford derailed on points approaching platform 2 at Ropley station. The train was stopped within 20 metres of the point of derailment by an instructor who was in the cab with the driver. There were no injuries as a result of the incident, and the train and track suffered limited damage.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the reversal of the points at Ropley by the signalman at the same time that the leading wheels of the train were passing over them. Causal factors were confusion by the signalman regarding the exact location of the train, and the lack of train detection on the points which allowed them to be moved under a train. There were three contributory factors and the RAIB also made four other additional observations about safety.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB has made six recommendations aimed at:\r\r\n\r\r\nthe provision of train detection on points;\r\r\nthe operating of the electric token block system;\r\r\nthe safety management system; and\r\r\nthe competence and medical standards for staff."
