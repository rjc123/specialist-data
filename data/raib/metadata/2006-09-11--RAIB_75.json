    "Summary:": "On Monday 11 September an empty South West Trains service was moving into Waterloo south sidings at low speed when it derailed on a set of points. These points had recently been subjected to unplanned maintenance.\r\r\nOn Tuesday 24 October a South West Trains service from Dorking to Waterloo derailed on a different set of points on the approaches to Waterloo. These points had also recently been subject to unplanned maintenance. Again, the derailment happened at low speed and there were no injuries. Some signalling and electrification equipment was damaged in the incident, and services from Waterloo were affected for several days while repairs were undertaken to the affected points and others exhibiting similar defects.\r\r\nThe immediate cause of both derailments was the condition of the switch blades within each set of points. These exhibited known derailment risks which had not been identified by the routine inspection process or by detailed inspections following maintenance activity. There were four causal and 13 contributory factors to the derailments.\r\r\nThere were six underlying causes to the derailment, which covered records management, understanding of standards and their requirements and inadequate track access for checking points.\r\r\nThe RAIB has made fourteen recommendations as a result of these incidents. These are aimed at:\r\r\n\r\r\n    the standards and guidance relating to points inspections;\u00a0\r\r\n    the training of inspection staff;\u00a0\r\r\n    the communication of information arising from inspections;\u00a0\r\r\n    track access; and\u00a0\r\r\n    the management of sub-contractors."
