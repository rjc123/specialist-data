    "Summary:": "On Friday 02 June 2005 a Northern Line tube train became derailed while entering the reversing siding at Archway station in north London. The rear bogie of the last car was derailed, and the car became wedged across the entrance to the siding tunnel. The only person on board, the train operator, was unhurt but damage was caused to the track and services suspended for the rest of the day.\r\r\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was a broken switch rail in the points leading to the reversing siding. A causal factor was a defect in the surface of the rail at the back end of the switch rail and the lack of a chamfer on this edge, which together created the conditions for a fatigue crack to develop. There were three contributory factors.\r\r\nThe RAIB has made three recommendations as a result of its investigation. They cover:\r\r\n\r\r\n    the design and continued use of bullhead switch rails;\u00a0\r\r\n    the track inspection system."
