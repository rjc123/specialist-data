    "Summary:": "On Friday 27 January 2006 a passenger train operated by 'one' ran into the buffer stops at Sudbury station. The collision occurred at just over 6mph as the train was braking. Approximately 100 passengers were on board, with a number of them suffering minor injuries, and one passenger sustaining suspected fractured ribs. No passengers were taken to hospital.\r\r\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the brakes of the train were not applied in a timely and appropriate manner. The only likely explanation of this is misjudgement by the driver. No further causal or contributory factors were identified.\r\r\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations as a result of its investigation. They cover:\r\r\n\r\r\n    Guidance for train crew on procedures following an accident;\u00a0\r\r\n    A review into energy absorbing buffer stops at terminal platforms."
