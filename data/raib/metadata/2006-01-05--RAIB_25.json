    "Summary:": "On Thursday 5 January 2006 a freight train left Meldon Quarry in Devon, bound for Hinksey yard near Oxford. Track circuit failures occurred separately at Urchfont and Kennington, in each case shortly after the freight train passed by. An examination of the line revealed one broken rail at Urchfont and two at Kennington. One of the freight wagons was subsequently found to have severe wheel flats.\r\r\nThe immediate cause of the broken rails was mechanical overload resulting from the impact of the damaged wheel on the rails. There were three causal factors. The underlying cause of the incident was a lack of information sharing between different parties involved, leading to no collective assessment of the risk from the flats and no mitigation.\r\r\nThe RAIB has made six recommendations as a result of its investigation, designed to reduce the risk of wheel flats occurring on the line and to improve detection of these faults."
