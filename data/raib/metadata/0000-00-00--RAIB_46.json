    "Summary:": "On Monday 01 May 2006 a train passed over Crofton Old Station No.1 level crossing whilst the crossing gates were open to the road. The gates had been open for approximately two minutes prior to the arrival of the train and a car had used the crossing around a minute before the train passed over the crossing.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Thursday 18 May 2006 a train passed over the same level crossing while one crossing gate was open to the road. At the time the train passed, the crossing keeper was attempting to close the gates to the road.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere were no injuries or damage caused in either incident.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe immediate cause of both incidents was that the signal protecting the level crossing showed clear aspect for the passage of trains whilst the level crossing gates were open to the road. Two causal factors were the lack of interlocking between the signals and the level crossing's gates, and human error in failing to follow the procedure for working the crossing. The report also identified four contributory factors to the incidents.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB has made six recommendations aimed at:\r\r\n\r\r\nprovision of interlocking at Crofton No 1 Level Crossing (already carried out by Network Rail);\r\r\nassessment of risk at Crofton No 1 Level Crossing, and at other similar crossings nationwide;\r\r\nstandards for level crossings; and\r\r\nensuring that the requirements of level crossing orders are complied with.",
