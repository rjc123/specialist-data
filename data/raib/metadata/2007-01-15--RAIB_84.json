    "Summary:": "On 15 January 2007 a passenger train operated by First Great Western was approaching Kemble station from the south when it derailed causing minor damage to the infrastructure and to the train. There were no injuries.  Train services were disrupted and the line was closed until 18 January 2007 to enable repairs to be undertaken.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe derailment was caused by debris on the track following the collapse of a wall immediately to the north of the railway.  Contributory factors include heavier than average rainfall during December 2006 and January 2007, the poor drainage of the cutting slope and a reclassification of the cutting by Network Rail, which led to less frequent examinations.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations as a result of this incident. Both relate to the management of wall structures and their infrastructure.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB are conducting a further investigation into the management of earthworks by Network Rail and issues relating to the earthworks at Kemble identified during this investigation will be taken forward as part of this further investigation."
