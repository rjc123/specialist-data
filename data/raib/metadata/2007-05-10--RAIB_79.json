    "Summary:": "On Thursday, 10 May 2007 at 06.40, an EWS empty coal train derailed on its approach to Newcastle station and caused significant damage to operating equipment on the track and King Edward Bridge; in addition several wagons were severely damaged.  There were no injuries but train services were disrupted and some tracks were closed for several days.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe immediate cause of the incident was a combination of a relatively minor track defect and a distorted wagon frame. Causal factors involved the wagon experiencing a twist as it passed over a set of points. There were also five contributory factors.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB has made four recommendations as a result of this incident. These involve:\r\r\n\r\r\nthe design and maintenance of the Carlisle line crossover at King Edward Bridge;\r\r\nstandards for track inspection and maintenance; and\r\r\nprocedures to detect defective wagons on the network."
