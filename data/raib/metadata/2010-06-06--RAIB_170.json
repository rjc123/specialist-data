    "Summary:": "At 20:55 hrs on Sunday 6 June 2010, the 18:20 hrs train from Glasgow Queen Street to Oban struck a boulder that had fallen onto the track just west of the station at Falls of Cruachan, in the Pass of Brander, on the line from Crianlarich to Oban. The boulder lifted up the front coach of the two-coach train and derailed it to the left and down an embankment. The leading bogie of the rear coach came to a stand supported by the boulder with the rear bogie still on the track.\r\r\nOf the 64 passengers and three crew on the train, eight of the passengers were taken to hospital with minor injuries.\r\r\nThe boulder had fallen down the cutting slope onto the railway from within the railway boundary. It had become insecure due to the growth of tree roots around it, which gradually prised it from its stable position, and soil erosion from normal rainfall. Network Rail\u2019s earthworks management system applied to cutting slopes had not  identified the hazard of loose boulders in the area that the accident occurred.\r\r\nThe RAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail relating to the management of earthworks. These include:\r\r\n\r\r\n    improving the clearance of vegetation growing on earthworks so that hazards to the safety of railway operation can be identified;\r\r\n    improvements to the collection of slope data so that a full appreciation of the condition of slopes is obtained; and \u00a0\r\r\n    improvements to the process for the implementation of remediation works to prevent future earthworks failures.\r\r\n\r\r\nA further recommendation has been made relating to the prevention of lighting diffusers and other saloon panels on rolling stock becoming displaced during accidents."
