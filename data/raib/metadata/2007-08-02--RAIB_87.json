    "Summary:": "On 2 August 2007 at approximately 15:22 hrs, train B413, the Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) service from Londonderry was 700 metres away from the disused station at Limavady Junction when it collided with a tractor on crossing XL202.  The tractor driver died as a result of his injuries.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe train was travelling at approximately 33 mph and the driver sounded the horn continuously as he approached the crossing. The train driver suffered shock and was taken to hospital.  None of the 65 passengers or the conductor were injured; the train was damaged but did not derail. Rail services re-commenced early the next day.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe investigation identified that the tractor driver may have lost concentration as he approached the crossing.  It suggests the position of the sun, the design of the crossing and the tractor's roof support pillar may have affected the tractor driver's view of the approaching train.  NIR has now redesigned the crossing.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe RAIB has made six recommendations relating to:\r\r\n\r\r\nlevel crossing signage;\r\r\nmanagement of risk at user worked crossings, and specifically crossing XL202;\r\r\nimproving the design of the evacuation ladders carried on NIR rolling stock."
