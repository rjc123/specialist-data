Prior to the alteration of course, the OOW onboard Dutch Progress observed the red sidelight and the masthead of the Ile D Yue 20&#186; on the starboard bow, at an approximate range of 4 miles. The OOW was unable to acquire Ile D Yue on either the 3cm or the 10cm ARPA radar displays, but was content that the intended alteration of course would be sufficient to avoid a collision. No visual bearing had been taken, and no radar plot obtained, but the OOW anticipated a CPA of about 5 cables down the port side.

With Whitby High Light almost abeam the skipper decided to start slowly heading toward the Bell Buoy, altering course to port from 320&#186; to 300&#186;.

Insufficient avoiding action, and an inadequate lookout by both vessels resulted in a collision.
