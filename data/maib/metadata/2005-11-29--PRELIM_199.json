The drill was completed and the lifeboat was left, in what was believed to have been, the standby condition.\n\nTwo days later, after a rough passage, the vessel was approaching its berth, 50% astern power was applied resulting in vibration throughout the after end of the vessel. Shortly afterwards the lifeboat was inadvertently launched. \n\nIt was found that the system had not been operated in accordance with the instructions, the drill was poorly managed and the signage in the lifeboat was confusing, especially regarding the standby condition of the lifeboat. \n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector wrote to Schat-Harding Ltd, the lifeboat and release equipment manufacturer, for details of their proposed Product Awareness Notice (PAN). The PAN, which is to be sent to affected customers will clarify the instructions and checks to be made to ensure the lifeboat is in the correct standby condition. \n\nAs a result of the examination the owners, James Fisher Ltd have: \n\n  * Specified the procedures to be followed for a simulated launch\n\n  * Established a check and signature system to ensure that the lifeboat is in the correct standby condition. \n\n  * Issued revised instructions on the conduct of drills\n\n* * *\n"
