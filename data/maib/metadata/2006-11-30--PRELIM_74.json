This resulted in the fisherman going overboard in adverse weather, in darkness and without a lifejacket. Fortunately the man was wearing a flotation suit, and, only because he was conscious, he was able to float face up. The skipper manoeuvred the boat alongside the casualty who was then recovered by his crewmates hanging over the bulwark rail whilst others held onto their legs.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents wrote to the owner of normal Peadar Elaine commending the vessel\u2019s skipper and crew on their seamanship skills but also highlighting the danger that the rest of the crew were placed in due to the lack of a man overboard recovery system. It was suggested that man overboard recovery should be reviewed as part of their risk assessment.\n\n* * *\n"
