The skipper and crewman were able to combat water ingress in the foc\u2019sle until the vessel was brought safely alongside in harbour a few minutes later. \n\nAfter inspecting for damage, Girl Jane subsequently put to sea for a repair yard some 6 miles away. No attempt was made to repair the damage or apply damage control measures, but instead water was kept at bay by means of a portable salvage pump. During the passage the pump air locked, resulting in uncontrollable flooding while the pump was re-primed. Luckily, the vessel did not sink due to the prompt assistance provided by the escorting lifeboat, which enabled the damaged vessel to be brought safely alongside the repair yard. \n\nAction taken:\n\n  * The owner of Girl Jane has replaced the autopilot with one which has a watch alarm incorporated. \n\n  * The RNLI has stated its intention to disseminate a reminder to all its stations regarding appropriate use of facilities and that the role of the RNLI is primarily to save life; not to escort already damaged vessels from a place of safety into the open sea. \n\nIn addition, the Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to Girl Jane\u2019s owner and skipper: \n\n  * To remind them of the need to keep a good lookout at all times. \n\n  * Advising them to consider attending a Seafish Industry Authority damage control course at an early opportunity. \n\n  * Advising them that a damaged vessel should not be taken from a place of safety into the open sea. \n\nPublished: June 2010\n\n* * *\n"
