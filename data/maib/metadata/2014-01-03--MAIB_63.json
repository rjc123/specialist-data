    "Summary:": "At 1521 (UTC+1) on 3 January 2014 the Liberia registered liquefied gas carrier, Navigator Scorpio, ran aground on Haisborough Sand in the North Sea. The vessel was undamaged by the grounding and there were no injuries or pollution; 2.5 hours later, it refloated on the rising tide. The investigation found that the vessel ran aground in restricted waters after the officer of the watch had become distracted and lost positional awareness. The passage plan was incomplete and the significant effects of wind and strong tidal streams had not been properly taken into account. Given the proximity to danger, appropriate navigational techniques were not applied and the bridge manning was insufficient. Additionally, weaknesses in the crew\u2019s navigation capability had been identified during an audit of the vessel, however, follow up actions were not sufficient to prevent the grounding.\r\r\nThe vessel\u2019s managers, Bernhard Shulte Shipmanagement, have conducted a thorough investigation into the grounding and taken action to prevent recurrence. This includes additional assessments and training for the crew of Navigator Scorpio as well as improvements to the safety management system. As a result, no safety recommendations are made in this report.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nReport No 30/2014 | Published 6 November 2014"
