Although fitted with a GPS receiver, navigation was by eye and the vessel had got too close to a bank where large waves are known to break at certain stages of the tide.\n\nAfter the vessel foundered, the three men were left in the sea and they elected to swim to the shore in the dark. The men were not wearing lifejackets and had no means of raising the alarm. The vessel\u2019s owner was picked up by another angling boat at 2024 and was landed and taken to hospital where he was treated for mild hypothermia.
