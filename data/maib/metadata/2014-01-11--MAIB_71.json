    "Report name:": "Rickmers Dubai/Kingston/Walcon Wizard", 
    "Summary:": "This reports the MAIB's investigation of the collision between the multi-purpose cargo ship Rickmers Dubai with the un-manned crane barge Walcon Wizard which was being towed by the tug Kingston in the south-west traffic lane of the Dover Strait TSS. The accident occurred as Rickmers Dubai was overtaking the tug and its tow.\r\r\n\r\r\nImmediately following the collision, the towline caught on Rickmers Dubai and Kingston was towed stern-first through the water until the towline ran free from its tow winch. Walcon Wizard was badly damaged and Rickmers Dubai\u2019s hull was punctured above the waterline. The hydraulic system for the tow winch on board Kingston was also damaged. There were no injuries and there was no pollution.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report found that:\r\r\n\r\r\nRickmers Dubai\u2019s OOW was alone on the bridge and he did not see Walcon Wizard. He did not keep a visual lookout or monitor the radar. Instead, he relied solely on AIS information for collision avoidance, which neither Kingston nor Walcon Wizard were transmitting.\r\r\nThe OOW was relatively inactive throughout his watch and did not take note of safety broadcasts issued by Dover Coastguard which included information regarding the position and movement of Kingston and its tow.\r\r\nThe towline secured to the winch on board Kingston could not be released from the wheelhouse, highlighting ambiguities in the regulatory requirements for the release of towlines.\r\r\n\r\r\nReport No 29/2014 | Published 23 October 2014"
