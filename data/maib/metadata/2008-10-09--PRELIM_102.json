The vessels were instructed to shift berths by Aberdeen port control: Caledonian Victory from berth No 3 to berth No 5, which was ahead of Caledonian Vanguard, and Caledonian Vanguard from berth No 4 to berth No 3. Caledonian Vanguard slipped and proceeded astern. During this manoeuvre, Caledonian Victory let go all ropes and, as soon as Caledonian Vanguard was on her port beam, started to move astern towards her intended berth. However, the bow of Caledonian Victory was soon influenced by the south-easterly wind and the ensuing manoeuvres resulted in the vessel\u2019s port quarter making contact with a number of pleasure vessels moored alongside a ro-ro berth on the north side of the Quay. Although voyage data recorders (VDR) were carried by both vessels, neither was working and therefore a detailed examination of the manoeuvring undertaken was not possible.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Deputy Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the vessel\u2019s manager and strongly advised that it instructs its masters to ensure that all passage plans, including berth shifts, are properly considered and take into account the environmental conditions, the limitations of the propulsion, and the assistance available, and that such plans are effectively communicated to all involved parties.\n\nThe Cayman Islands administration has also written to the ship\u2019s manager to remind it of its responsibility to ensure the correct operation of VDRs on board its vessels.\n\nThe vessel\u2019s manager, Vector Offshore, has replaced the VDR on board Caledonia Victory and has undertaken to replace the VDRs on three sister vessels.\n\nPublished: OCTOBER 2008\n\n* * *\n"
