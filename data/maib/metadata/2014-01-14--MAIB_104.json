Issued February 2014.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe initial stage of the MAIB investigation found the most likely cause of the fire to be an uninsulated exhaust pipe from an air heater being in close proximity to the plywood structure of the vessel. Evidence from similar vessels indicated that this was not an isolated case and this Safety Bulletin was published with the following advice to owners and operators:\r\r\n\r\r\nCheck that all exhaust pipes on their vessels are fully insulated and do not come close to combustible material.\r\r\nFit fire/smoke detectors in enclosed spaces where diesel-fired air heaters are installed.\r\r\nAvoid placing flammable material in compartments that contain potential heat sources."
