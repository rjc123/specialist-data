The RIB continued to circle round the family, striking a number of them and causing two fatalities and seriously injuring two others.Report No 5/2014. Published 30 January 2014.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe key safety issues identified were:\r\r\n\r\r\nA Kill cord was not attached to the driver at the time of the accident.\r\r\nThe drivers were unprepared for the boat\u2019s reaction when it was turned at speed and then \u201chooked\u201d as they did not have the level of boat handling skills required to control such a turn.\r\r\nTrials undertaken on the boat found that it developed a high angle of heel when turned at high speeds.\r\r\nOccupants should be seated, holding on and as far aft as possible when boats are travelling at speed."
