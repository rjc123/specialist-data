After shutting off the fuel supply to the engine and closing the vent flaps, the fixed CO2 system successfully extinguished the fire. Meanwhile, boundary cooling and continuous liaison with those ashore was maintained while the vessel returned to port. The vessel was met by the fire and rescue service, who quickly determined that the fire was already out. Damage was limited to one of the two domestic electrical supply inverter units; there was no other damage to the vessel.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe MAIB: the Deputy Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to Windcat Workboats commending its crew for their actions in successfully tackling the fire. He has also made suggestions on how to improve some aspects of the CO2 system, fire drills, and operations manuals.\n\nWindcat Workboats: has renewed both inverters on Windcat 3; they are continuing to improve their operations manual and review their safety management system, on an ongoing basis. \n\nPublished: June 2010\n\n* * *\n"
