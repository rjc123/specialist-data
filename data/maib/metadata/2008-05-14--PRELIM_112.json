The vessel sustained damage to her stern plating above the waterline; the wharf was also damaged\n\nThe berthing operation required the vessel to be turned through 180\u00b0 before mooring port side to. At the start of the turn, the captain controlled the azipod propulsion units and bow thrusters from the bridge\u2019s centre console, but once the berth was open on the vessel\u2019s port side, he moved to the port wing console accompanied by the embarked harbour pilot and the staff captain. \n\nOnce on the port bridge wing, the captain adjusted the main engine controls to arrest the vessel\u2019s movement astern. However, this had no effect because the control of the azipod propulsion units had not been transferred to the port console. The vessel continued to move astern until contact was made with the quay. Shortly afterwards, the bridge team realised that the control of the propulsion units had not been transferred. This was rectified and the vessel was then manoeuvred alongside without further difficulty.\n\nAction taken:\n\nCarnival UK. has investigated the accident. Recommendations made in its investigation report covered:\n\n  * The implementation of the company\u2019s Bridge Team Command and Control procedures and training.\n\n  * The issue of a fleet cautionary notice identifying the lessons learned from this accident.\n\n  * The procedures for the transfer and testing of propulsion control.\n\n  * The feasibility of fitting synchronous or follow-up systems.\n\n  * The size of the azipod control indicator lamps fitted to the control consoles. \n\n  * The review of the visual displays fitted on the vessel\u2019s bridge wings. \n\n  * The insulation of noisy equipment on the port bridge wing.\n\n  * The inclusion of masters in bridge and console design processes.\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has held a meeting with Carnival UK and has satisfied himself that the current and proposed actions of Carnival UK and Carnival Corporation will help prevent similar accidents from occurring in the future.\n\nPublished: JULY 2008\n\n* * *\n"
