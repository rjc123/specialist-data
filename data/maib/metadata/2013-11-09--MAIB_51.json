    "Summary:": "The skipper of Horizon II was returning to his vessel after a night ashore. His vessel was berthed within the marina and was outboard of the fishing vessel New Dawn.\r\r\nAs he attempted to climb the bulwark rail of New Dawn, he slipped and fell backwards. He hit his head on the quay wall and fell between the vessel and quay. Although the fall was seen by a marina employee, the skipper was unable to be recovered until 28 minutes later by the RNLI. The skipper could not be resuscitated. \r\r\n\r\r\nThe investigation found that: \r\r\n\r\r\nAlthough guidance is provided, there was no requirement for New Dawn\u2019s skipper to provide a suitable means of access or egress \r\r\nThe safety measures prescribed in Horizon II\u2019s risk assessment folder relating to vessel access and alcohol consumption were not being implemented.\r\r\nHorizon II\u2019s skipper would have been over the alcohol drink-drive limit had the vessel sailed as intended the following morning.\r\r\nThe marina\u2019s risk assessments did not include safe access to the fishing vessel berths, although a previous similar accident had occurred a year earlier.\r\r\nThe safety equipment available at the middle pier berth was insufficient to recover a person in the water.\r\r\nThe marina\u2019s safety rail on the middle pier introduced an unnecessary hazard to gain access to the fishing vessel berths.\r\r\n\r\r\nReport No 23/2014 | Published 10 September 2014."
