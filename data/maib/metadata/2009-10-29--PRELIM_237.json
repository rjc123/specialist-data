This was immediately followed by a series of heavy thumps. The gearbox was put into neutral as the chief engineer stopped the engine believing that the vessel had hit an underwater object which may have passed through the propeller. Subsequent checks found that the propeller shaft to be seized. A small hole was also found in the hull in the engine room. External fothering stemmed the water ingress while the hole was shored up, which significantly reduced the flow of water, enabling the bilge pumps to cope easily.\n\nThe vessel was towed to Sullum Voe, where long heavy gauge monofilament line were found to have caused the shaft seizure and consequent widespread damage to the main gearbox components.
