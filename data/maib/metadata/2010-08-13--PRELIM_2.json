The vessel began a substantial turn to port as part of its manoeuvres to reach the pilot station. During the turn, Royal Oasis was set by the strong 3 knot tidal stream that was running, and she collided with another bulk carrier, Berge Atlantic, which had been anchored 1.3 miles astern of Royal Oasis\u2019s original position. The collision caused extensive structural damage to both vessels.\n\nThe preliminary examination found that the strength of the tidal stream had not been identified in the passage plan or discussed in a pre-departure briefing. It is most likely, from the manner in which the manoeuvre was executed, that the effect of the tidal stream on Royal Oasis\u2019s turning performance was not properly considered before it left the anchorage. Pre-departure checklists had not been used for testing equipment, and emergency procedures in the safety management system were difficult to use and not readily available.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has made a recommendation to the operators of Royal Oasis highlighting the deficiencies found in the safety management system and navigational procedures. Associated British Ports (South Wales) has worked with local shipping agents to include warnings about the strength of tidal streams in pre-arrival notices to ships. It is also investigating ways of highlighting tidal information in hydrographic publications. \n\nPublished: September 2010\n\n* * *\n"
