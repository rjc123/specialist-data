    "Summary:": "At 0219 on 25 July 2013, the tanker Apollo was rounding Tilburyness, River Thames,in a strong tidal flow when it left its intended track and made contact with the quayside at the Northfleet Hope Container Terminal. The vessel and the quayside\r\r\nboth sustained significant damage as a result of the accident.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe vessel\u2019s manager has taken action to prevent a recurrence. A recommendation has been made to the Port of London Authority, the UK Marine Pilots Association and the Port Marine Safety Code Steering Group to develop best practice guidelines for the conduct of practical pilotage examinations.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe key safety issues identified were:\r\r\n\r\r\nTilburyness is an area with strong and complex tidal streams and there have been 4 accidents in this area since 2007.\r\r\nThe information regarding the vessel\u2019s propulsion system was not readily available to the pilots, either through the port\u2019s information data system or the vessel\u2019s pilot card.\r\r\nThe examination was not conducted in a commentary style, compromising the ability of the bridge team to communicate effectively. \r\r\nThe size of the vessel was inappropriate for the examination as it was larger than the size for which the pilot was being examined. \r\r\n\r\r\nReport No 15/2014 | Published 12 June 2014"
