The pilot took over the ship\u2019s controls just off the port, and stemmed the 3-4 knot flood tide with Gladstone lock on his starboard beam. The weather conditions were good with only a light breeze. \n\nSmit Collingwood approached stern to stern with Velazquez ready to make fast a tow line from her aft tow winch as normal. A heaving line was thrown down from Velazquez to the single crewman on the aft deck of the tug and the tug\u2019s messenger line was attached. The ship\u2019s aft mooring deck crew manually heaved the messenger line, through the panama eye. A seaman put 4-5 turns of messenger line on the drum end, at which point the officer-in-charge instructed the winch control crewman to start heaving slowly. \n\nAround this time, Smit Collingwood unexpectedly started to move off to port and away from the stern of Velazquez. Although the tug\u2019s tow wire was veered by the crewman on the tug\u2019s aft deck and heaving was stopped on the ship\u2019s aft deck, the messenger line started to pull off the ship\u2019s drum end. The seaman near the drum end saw a riding turn starting to form and he stepped in to clear it. He stood on the heaving line which was lying on the deck and still attached to the messenger line.
