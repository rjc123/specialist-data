They had set up camp and decided to use their small boat to visit a pub on the opposite shore. After spending some time in the pub, they attempted to use the boat to return to their campsite. Thick fog had developed and at 0300, a member of the party who had stayed at the campsite woke and heard calls for help from the Loch. He attempted to guide his friends back to the shore by lighting fires and using lights from their vehicles, which were parked nearby. This was not successful and he called the Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) for assistance.\n\nThe FRS alerted other emergency services and Police, FRS, Ambulance and Coastguard Rescue Teams attended. A Search and Rescue Helicopter was scrambled, but thick fog prevented it from getting close to the Loch. An FRS water rescue unit was called for and, on arrival at the Loch, searched for and recovered two casualties from the water. Despite the efforts of medical teams, they could not be revived.
