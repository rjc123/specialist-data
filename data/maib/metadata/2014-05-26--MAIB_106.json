    "Summary:": "At about 0645 on 26 May 2014, while the timber cargo on board the German registered general cargo vessel Suntis was being discharged, three crew members entered a cargo hold access compartment. Another crewman saw one of his colleagues collapse in the compartment and raised the alarm. A frantic rescue operation ensued. During the recovery of the three unconscious crewmen, safety equipment was used incorrectly and inappropriately. The three crewmen did not survive.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe investigation found that the oxygen levels within the compartment had been depleted, probably by the timber cargo, with levels of 5% - 6% recorded at the compartment deck.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn summary:\r\r\n\r\r\nThree crew collapsed and died after entering an oxygen deficient compartment on board the vessel.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt is likely that the second and third crew members entered the space to attempt to rescue their colleagues(s).\r\r\n\r\r\nThe vessel had no rescue plan or appropriate rescue equipment in place.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt is fortunate that more lives were not lost during the disorganised rescue attempt."
