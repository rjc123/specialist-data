Sadly one of the casualties died. \n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector has written to the skipper and owner of the yacht highlighting the safety issues, concerning: \n\nMaking full use of weather forecast information and the need to consider of back-up plans, \n\n  * The benefit of hand steering in heavy seas, \n\n  * The need for lifelines even while in the cockpit, and \n\n  * The benefit of carrying an EPIRB, especially when operating outside of coastguard VHF radio range \n\n* * *\n"
