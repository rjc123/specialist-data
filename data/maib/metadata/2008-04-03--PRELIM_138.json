At 0645 she shot her nets and commenced trawling for prawn until 1215 when, as the trawl was being recovered, the central warp parted. The outer warps and nets were then recovered and the vessel made for Blyth to take on replacement wires for all three warps.\n\nAt 1630, when the vessel was close to Blyth, the crew made preparations for fitting the new wires by removing the old outer wires of the three warps and then end for ending the inner wires to ensure the strongest wire would be available for trawling once the new wires were received and fitted in Blyth. By 1645, work on the two outer wires had been completed and the crew began work on the centre wire. \n\nThe end for ending process required the crew to feed the wire over the stern in a long bight as the vessel made way, head to sea, at about 3 knots. The outer end of the wire had earlier been secured with a rope stopper and, once the wire had been payed out, another stopper was secured to the inner end of the wire to prevent movement while the joining shackle was removed.
