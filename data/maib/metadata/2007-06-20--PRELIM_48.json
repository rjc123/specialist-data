At 1159, while preparing to transfer the third pilot at the Sunk, dense smoke poured from the engine vents and almost immediately afterwards both engines stopped.  The wheelhouse then started to fill with smoke as the pilot alerted Harwich VTS.  The Harwich lifeboat and an RAF rescue helicopter were tasked within two minutes.  The crew struggled to close the engine room vents because the location of the operating levers put them in the centre of the acrid smoke zone.
