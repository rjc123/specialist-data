The weather conditions were good. After embarking a local pilot at 0115 UTC, speed was adjusted to ensure that the vessel arrived over the Shell NGL pipeline, the shallowest part of the route, at about high water.\n\nAs the vessel approached the pipeline, port control advised the pilot that the reading on the Ribny tide gauge was 4.3m. This indicated that the vessel would have minimal clearance over the pipeline; speed was reduced to 3 knots to minimise the effect of squat, and the vessel\u2019s course was adjusted to keep her in the deepest part of the navigable channel. Celtica Hav grounded as she passed over the Shell gas pipeline at 0300. \n\nThere were no injuries to persons, or pollution, and the vessel was refloated at the following high water. \n\nAction taken:\n\nPerth and Kinross Council, the port operator, has increased the minimum under keel clearance required for a vessel to pass over the pipeline. It has also recalibrated the Ribny tide gauge and commissioned consultants to examine options for improving navigational safety in the vicinity of the pipeline. \n\nShell UK Ltd commissioned a study to assess the effect of vessels grounding on the pipeline. The study concluded that the stresses generated by the grounding of Celtica Hav and other vessels of similar size were within acceptable limits. \n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to Perth and Kinross Council, recommending it to: \n\nEnsure that the recently increased minimum under keel clearance required by vessels passing over the Shell NGL pipeline is strictly adhered to, and that the risks associated with any proposed dredging in the vicinity of the pipeline are fully assessed in consultation with key stakeholders.\n\nPublished: JULY 2009\n\n* * *\n"
