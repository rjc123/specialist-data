The river passage from Bull anchorage was undertaken with an ABP Humber pilot on board. The Humber pilot disembarked at Blacktoft and an Ouse pilot embarked to conduct the rest of the passage to Howdendyke, which included passing through the Goole railway swing bridge. \n\nDuring the master/pilot exchange, the master was given the Ouse pilot passage plan and in return the pilot was shown the vessel\u2019s pilot card. The target time for arrival at Howdendyke was 0030. High water at Goole was at 0017 and it was neap tides.\n\nThe vessel left Blacktoft at 2250, with the pilot steering at the central console. It was calm, there was clear visibility and it was dark. After passing Goole and on the approach to the bridge, the pilot, on the master\u2019s suggestion, changed his steering position to the starboard side of the wheelhouse, while the master remained at the central console. \n\nThe vessel began passing through the narrow eastern channel of the swing bridge with the flood tide, at about 5 knots over the ground. When half-way through, the master saw that the vessel was being set towards the eastern buttress and asked the pilot what he was going to do about it. The pilot applied hard to starboard helm and placed the engine on full ahead. However, the vessel\u2019s starboard quarter made a glancing contact with the buttress. The vessel continued on passage and was secured alongside at Howdendyke at 0030.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to British Waterways (the competent harbour authority for the River Ouse at the Goole railway swing bridge and Howdendyke) strongly advising them: \n\n  * to include in the Ouse pilot passage plan the required speed for transiting through the Goole Railway Bridge; and \n\n  * to require a more detailed discussion during the master/pilot exchange so that masters are able to challenge decisions or actions taken by pilots at an early stage in order that, when required, effective corrective action can be taken to prevent accidents; \n\nand suggesting that they should consider the best practice of a pilot not acting as helmsman.\n\nThe Chief Inspector has also written to the owner of Montis, highlighting the need for effective dialogue between the master and the pilot in order that the master can be assured of the intentions of the pilot at an early stage. \n\nPublished: JULY 2008\n\n* * *\n"
