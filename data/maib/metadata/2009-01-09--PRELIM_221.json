Two seamen were preparing the port rescue boat for the task when the master instructed them to use the starboard workboat instead.\n\nAs the rescue boat had been made ready to launch, the master decided to use this for a boat drill. Once this had taken place, the senior AB unhooked the workboat from the forward hand-operated davit and connected it, instead, to the aft electrically-driven stores davit. The senior AB and cadet boarded the workboat and the chief officer instructed the second AB to hoist it off the cradle. As the second officer and AB-cook slewed the davit to move the workboat over the side, it swung round uncontrollably and made slight contact with the ship\u2019s funnel.\n\nThe boat was brought under control and swung outboard with the assistance of the master, who was on the quay, pulling on one of the slewing ropes. The workboat was then lowered. When it had descended approximately 2m, the wire parted close to the hook, and the boat, with its occupants, fell 8m into the water. Both the senior AB and the cadet suffered serious injuries, but were able to climb out of the boat and on to the quay. The emergency services took them to hospital and they were discharged from the vessel to enable them to receive further treatment and to recuperate.\n\nActions taken:\n\nFaversham Ships Ltd has: \n\n  * Decommissioned the stores davits on Velox and her sister vessel.\n  * Notified all ships in its fleet about the accident.\n  * Commissioned a review of lifting appliances throughout its fleet.\n  * Engaged an external consultant to review the company safety management system.\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has recommended that Faversham Ships Ltd ensures its Safety Management System captures all safety significant activities on board its vessels; and the associated safety equipment is effectively operated, maintained and inspected by competent personnel.\n\nPublished: NOVEMBER 2009\n\n* * *\n"
