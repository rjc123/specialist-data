On the morning of the accident, the coxswain of the pilot boat Haven Harrier agreed to transport three tug crew members from the pontoon to Harwich.\n\nHaven Harrier approached the pontoon with the coxswain at the helm and the deckhand at the bow to assist as required. The coxswain manoeuvred the boat so as to lean the port shoulder onto the pontoon\u2019s tyre fenders while the men boarded. The first two men stepped on board, without incident. The third man, who was carrying two small bags in his right hand, stepped onto a tyre fender with his right foot and was about to step onto the boat\u2019s deck with his left foot. The boat\u2019s bow pitched down and the man, realising that he was in danger of falling onto the boat, decided to fall backwards onto the pontoon instead. As he did so, the bow pitched up, rode over the fender, and then pitched down again, trapping the man\u2019s lower leg between the pontoon and the boat\u2019s hull. \n\nAction taken:\n\nRisk assessments for use of the pontoon have since been revised and operational instructions now require:\n\n  * pilot boats to reduce speed well in advance of approaching the pontoon; \n\n  * vessels to be parallel alongside and secured with at least one line before boarding or disembarkation begins; and \n\n  * tyre fenders not to be used as steps during boarding or disembarkation. \n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the Chief Executive of Harwich Haven Authority with respect to the use of objective marine expertise in future risk assessments, and to the dangers of complacency. \n\nPublished: JANUARY 2009\n\n* * *\n"
