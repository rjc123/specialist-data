On removing the damaged motor from No.1 lifeboat winch, the lifeboat unexpectedly released and lowered to the water at a controlled speed. No damage was sustained and the operational motor was then successfully transferred and used to recover No.1 lifeboat. \n\nSubsequent investigation revealed that when the damaged motor had been removed, the pinion gearwheel shaft also withdrew from the housing.
