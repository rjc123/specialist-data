The ship moored at 1430 using a mix of ropes and wires. The forward moorings comprised 2 head lines, 3 breasts lines (1 wire and 1 rope on a bight) and 3 back springs (1 wire and 1 rope on a bight).

The ropes on the forward mooring deck were left on the winch warping drum ends and backed up on bitts with figure of eight turns around a single bitt. \n\nThroughout the afternoon the wind was north easterly at 34 knots. At about 1810, broken strands were found on one of the after stern wires. A decision was made to replace the wire but no consideration was given to sending out an additional wire prior to removing the damaged one.

However, the Chief Inspector has also advised against the practice, where possible, of; \n\n  * Routinely leaving ropes on drum ends in favour of securing ropes on bitts \n\n  * Mixing ropes and wires for the same type of mooring i.e breast, stern, head and spring lines. \n\n* * *\n"
