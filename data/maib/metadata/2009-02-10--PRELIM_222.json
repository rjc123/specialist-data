During loading the 300 watt hold lights, which were an unapproved modification carried out under the vessel\u2019s previous ownership, were switched on.\n\nWhile on passage to Glasgow, smoke was seen to escape from the cargo hold\u2019s starboard after ventilation terminal. Soon afterwards the hot hold lights were found to be still switched on. A 4-man Maritime Incident Response Group (MIRG) from East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service was subsequently transferred by helicopter to the vessel to assess and monitor the incident. The hold and adjacent compartment temperatures were found to be normal and the vessel made her own way into Southampton. Part of the cargo was removed while a fire-fighting team from the Hampshire Fire Rescue Service was in attendance. A small amount of smouldering cargo was doused down, which was found in the vicinity of the hold\u2019s starboard after halogen light, which was fitted inside the lower section of the ventilation trunking. \n\nActions taken:\n\nThe vessel\u2019s technical manager has been advised to: \n\n  * Seek advice regarding the suitability of the hold lighting system to ensure it complies with the classification society\u2019s rules.\n  * Introduce suitable checks to ensure that the approved hold lighting system is switched off when the hold is unattended.\n\nThe technical manager has:\n\n  * Instructed its fleet to remove all hold lights which were not installed during build.\n\nPublished: NOVEMBER 2009\n\n* * *\n"
