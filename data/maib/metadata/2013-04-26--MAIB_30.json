    "Summary:": "This reports the MAIB\u2019s investigation of an accommodation fire on a United Kingdom registered general cargo ship on passage from Gibraltar to Belfast. The fire, which started after a crew member fell asleep in bed while holding a lit cigarette, caused an electrical failure of the ship\u2019s steering gear, and resulted in heat, smoke and water damage to the majority of the accommodation spaces.  One crew member was injured and the ship was subsequently towed to Cadiz for repair. \r\r\n\r\r\nThe key safety issues identified were:\r\r\n\r\r\nCeltic Carrier\u2019s crew were ill-prepared for the emergency; there was a lack of leadership, and sub-standard fire-fighting techniques resulted in crew members being unnecessarily exposed to danger.\r\r\nThe records of some emergency drills recorded in the ship\u2019s Official Log Book were falsified, which calls into question the validity of other records and demonstrates that a complacent approach to safety existed on board.\r\r\nThe ship owners need to involve its crews in the application of the SMS to ensure its success was not fully recognised.\r\r\nThe lack of a national database for International Safety Management Code audits constrained the Maritime and Coastguard\u2019s ability to conduct fleet performance trend analysis, and to ensure that a consistent approach to auditing was carried out.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nReport No 18/2014 | Published 16 July 2014."
