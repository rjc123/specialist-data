This was the first trip after the Christmas break. Having loaded ice, the skipper moved the boat to another berth so that a repair could be carried out on his fish finder display. The skipper and crew went ashore to wait for completion of the repair and were back on board by 2000. The boat sailed at 2035. Leaving the harbour, Fisher Boys made contact with one of the piers.

He called the skipper who decided that they should return to port to investigate the problem. At about 0700, the bilge alarm sounded. This alarm was set to sound at a level just above the top of the well in the fish hold. The skipper started the main bilge pump, which ran off the auxiliary engine. About 10 minutes later he checked the discharge and saw that no water was being pumped out. He returned to the engine room, where he dismantled the suction valve and removed a small amount of debris. Replacing the valve he found he still could not get suction, and so started a second bilge pump, which ran off the main engine. However, after running for about 10 minutes, the discharge from this pump also stopped. Inspecting the fish hold bilge, the skipper noted that the water was washing over the concrete ballast which lined the base of the hold. He also noticed that the water was running from forward through a redundant cable gland opening in the forward bulkhead.

This was replied to by the coastguard, who then started to co-ordinate a rescue. A number of oil rig supply vessels responded, the closest being less than 30 minutes steaming away.
