By this time, considerable damage had been caused to both the cargo and the ship\u2019s structure. \n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the ship\u2019s managers strongly advising them to review: \n\n  * Cargo securing arrangements for heavy weather \n\n  * Bridge team resource management \n\n  * Perceived pressures Master may have to maintain liner schedules\n\n  * Reporting requirements to relevant authorities in the event of accidents which may compromise the safety of the crew and/or the seaworthiness of the vessel. \n\n* * *\n"
