Despite the master\u2019s attempts to recover control of the CPP system, the pitch remained at approximately 40% ahead, causing the vessel to accelerate. Although a forward spring was deployed and the tug Guardsman attempted to slow the vessel\u2019s progress by pushing, the vessel impacted heavily with the outer lock gates at 3.7 knots. The east outer gate sustained major damage and subsequently sank, with minor damage reported to other lock gates. The lock was re-opened over 24 hours later with vessel-length operational restrictions after the sunken gate was recovered. Both CFL Patron and the tug sustained minor damage, the former to her bulbous bow; there were no injuries or pollution. The cause of the CPP control power failure could not be determined.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the vessel\u2019s manager, CFL Shipmanagement B.V., regarding emergency preparedness for propulsion failures on its vessels; pre-departure testing of propulsion systems; and preservation of evidence and data following an accident.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPublished: November 2010\n\n* * *\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n"
