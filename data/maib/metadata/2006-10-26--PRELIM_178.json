The vessel was on passage to the port of Perth and weather conditions were poor with storm force winds from the WSW at the time of the grounding. The vessel was undamaged and she re-floated on the following tide and then continued upriver safely to her berth. \n\nThe prime reason for the accident was an exceptional \u201ccut\u201d in the tide of more than 60cm from the predicted level. This phenomena, which is unpredictable on the River Tay, was caused by the particular meteorological conditions. The gas pipeline crosses the river at a shallow point and this was the second grounding at this location within twelve months. \n\nThe investigation discovered that the pipeline is buried well beneath the river bed and encased in concrete and not, therefore, liable to be damaged by vessels taking the ground.

A tidal gauge fitted at Newburgh, further downriver from the pipeline had been inoperable for over a year and there was no precise indication of tidal height at the pipeline crossing.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the harbour master of the Portof Perthnoting: \n\n  * the port\u2019s decision to place a fixed tide gauge and weather station at the affected gas pipeline crossing; and \n\n  * its decision to change the Newburgh tide gauge\u2019s remote operating modem to GSM technology; and,\n\n  * requesting the port authority to keep the MAIB lead inspector apprised of progress with these actions. \n\n* * *\n"
