On board were the skipper and a crewman. The net was shot away at about 2120, and the vessel towed south towards the fishing grounds.

Towing watches were shared between the skipper and crewman, with both of them up for hauling, shooting and sorting the catch.\n\nAt approximately 1300, shortly before the skipper was intending to haul, the net came fast on an obstruction. Adjusting the engine control to give minimum ahead speed, the skipper put the winch into gear and hauled the trawl warps until they were \u201cup and down\u201d. He then attempted to work the fastener clear by alternately heaving and slackening the gear. This had no effect, and, realising that the fastener was moving, he decided to tow the object into shallower water and to then try to free it again. \n\nThe time was roughly 1400, and a northerly course was set. Due to the tide and wind both acting on the starboard side, the vessel\u2019s ground track was approximately WNW at about 1.5 knots.\n\nAt about 1500, realising that the vessel was making little progress, the skipper decided to have another attempt to remove the fastener. He hauled the gear until once again the warps were \u201cup and down\u201d. Keeping the engine in gear and running ahead, he applied the port warp brake, disengaged the port dog clutch, and heaved on the starboard warp. The port warp then slipped suddenly, transferring all of the weight to the starboard warp. Under the combined effect of this increased weight, the wind and tide acting on the starboard side, and the engine running ahead, the vessel began to capsize to starboard.\n\nThe skipper, who had been standing at the winch controls, leapt over the starboard side, while the crewman, who had been sitting on the step leading into the wheelhouse, leapt over the port side.
