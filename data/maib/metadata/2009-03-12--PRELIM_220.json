The skipper went to bed early in the evening, but the crewman continued to work in the engine room. Later in the evening, the skipper heard the engine room door shut and thought that the crewman had finished work and had turned in. In the morning, the skipper became concerned that the crewman was not up and ready to sail, and he went to look for him.\n\nThe skipper found the crewman in the vessel\u2019s forward store, where he had collapsed next to a portable petrol powered generator. Ambulance crews could not revive the crewman and the postmortem examination determined that he had very high levels of carbon monoxide in his blood stream. \n\nThe generator was not part of the vessel\u2019s equipment and was found to have been brought on board by the crewman for his own purposes. There was still petrol in the generator\u2019s fuel tank and the controls were set to allow it to run. Ventilation openings to the forward store were still closed in the sea going position and, although the hatch was partially open, it is likely that carbon monoxide in the exhaust fumes built up quickly and overcame the crewman when he attempted to run the generator. \n\nAction taken:\n\nMAIB has written to the owner reminding him of the need to make sure that crew understand the risks from exhaust fumes and do not create new hazards by bringing unauthorised equipment on board. \n\nPublished: December 2009\n\n* * *\n"
