As a result, the electrical hydraulic pumps supplying the vessel\u2019s Controllable Pitch Propellers (CPPs) also stopped. This caused the propellers\u2019 pitch to move to 100% astern. As the main engines were still running, the vessel\u2019s speed astern towards a concrete quay increased. To arrest the vessel\u2019s movement, the main engines were stopped using the emergency stop buttons on the bridge, and the starboard anchor was let go. However, this did not stop the vessel from making contact with the quay. \n\nAction taken:\n\nThe ship owner has:\n\n  * Carried out a technical investigation that concluded the vessel\u2019s auxiliary engines had shut down due to the performance of the differing automatic voltage regulators (AVRs) and speed governing motors fitted. \n\n  * Initiated the replacement of the AVRs and speed governors. \n\n  * Instructed the vessel\u2019s crew to operate the auxiliary engines above 60 Hz at all times and to positively manage the starting of heavy duty electrical machinery until the AVR and governor problems have been addressed. \n\nThe Deputy Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the vessel\u2019s owner and strongly advised that it: \n\n  * Resolves the problems with the vessel\u2019s auxiliary engines as soon as possible. \n\n  * Establishes a robust on board planned maintenance system. \n\n  * Ensures its crews are aware of the \u2018fail-safe\u2019 positions of critical equipment such as CPP systems.\n\nPublished: AUGUST 2008\n\n* * *\n"
