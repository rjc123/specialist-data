At approximately 1400 on 29 May the nets were being hauled on board when the engine room bilge alarm sounded.  The skipper cancelled the alarm, switched on the electric bilge pump and continued hauling. </p>\r\r\n<p> At about 1410, the haul was completed.  The skipper then went to the engine-room to de-clutch the hydraulic pump from the main engine while the rest of the crew made lunch. As the skipper entered the engine room he found that the bilge water level was up to the floor plates but he could not see where it had originated from.  He re-configured the on-engine pump from deck wash supply to bilge pump suction but was unable to shut the seacocks as they were under water.  The skipper immediately returned to the wheelhouse.  He told the crew of the flooding and instructed them to don their lifejackets as a precaution. </p>\r\r\n<p>Immediately afterwards, the skipper started the second electric bilge pump, but the two emergency hand-operated bilge pumps could not be used as these were stripped down for maintenance.  The skipper then contacted the nearby fishing vessel Ben My Chree, informing them of the problem.  Afterwards, he returned to the engine room and found that the water level had increased by a further 20cm and was now well above the floor plates and half way up the main engine. To determine the extent of flooding the skipper checked the fish room and found water at the same level as that in the engine room.

A &#8220;Mayday Relay&#8221; was also broadcast by the coastguard, and a number of vessels responded, including Ben My Chree, which made her way towards Girl Patricia.
