A harbour pilot was embarked and was conning the vessel; the ship\u2019s master was on the helm. The grounding occurred within the port limits and resulted from an inability to check the vessel\u2019s turn into the main approach channel. The ship was re-floated at 1332 with the assistance of a pilot launch and berthed in Rye Harbour at 1359.\n\nAction Taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the port authority, advising:\n\n  * The re-evaluation of the approach to the port normally adopted by pilots in order to avoid significant course alterations in close proximity to the entrance channel whenever possible. \n\n  * Pilots always request information relating to the rudder and steering arrangements, propulsion type and power output, propeller type and manoeuvring characteristics of vessels, when such information is not otherwise offered. \n\n  * Key information pertinent to the safe navigation of a vessel in the port is obtained prior to her arrival, particularly when it is a ship\u2019s first visit. \n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has also written to the ship manager, advising:\n\n  * The information contained on the pilot cards carried by its ships includes the manoeuvring characteristics of the vessel concerned, such as the effects of the wind and behaviour at slow speed and in shallow water. \n\n  * Its masters to discuss all the information contained on the pilot card with the pilot as soon as the pilot embarks. \n"
