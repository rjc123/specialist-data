Approximately 50m\u00b3 of the gas oil spilled into the dock, but was quickly contained by terminal and port authority personnel. There were no injuries but the barge was a constructive total loss.\n\nThe barge was purchased by Henty Oil Ltd in 2004 and lay alongside in Liverpool until entering service as a floating oil storage vessel in 2006. Her suitability for this use was confirmed by annual \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 surveys conducted in accordance with the port\u2019s regulations. The surveys did not identify the lack of basic stability and bending moment information, or require the barge to be inspected in dry dock.\n\nIt is probable that the structural failure of the hull resulted from long-term fatigue compounded by the distribution of the cargo, which would have induced a near maximum bending moment with the barge in a sagged condition. There were no written procedures for the loading or discharge of the barge\u2019s cargo.\n\nAction taken:\n\n  * The Deputy Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to Henty Oil Ltd advising that, when using a barge for oil storage and distribution purposes in the future, all cargo is loaded and discharged in accordance with written procedures, taking into account relevant stability and bending moment limitations, and industry best practice. \n\n  * The Deputy Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has also written to Mersey Ports strongly advising it ensures that all \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 surveys are carried out to a common standard and give due consideration to a vessel\u2019s age and operation. \n\nPublished: August 2010\n\n* * *\n"
