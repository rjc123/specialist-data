Soon afterwards, the pilot asked the master to let go the forward tug Tenax, which had its tow line fast to a bollard on the starboard side, just aft of the forward mooring station.

An able seaman, the bosun and another able seaman stood in line between the panama lead and the bollard and began to pull the slack of the tow line in by hand. \n\nMeanwhile on the tug, the chief engineer moved the towing winch control joystick to pay out the line and to give the ship\u2019s crew some more slack.
