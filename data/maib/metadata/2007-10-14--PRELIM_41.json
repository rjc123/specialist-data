The crew then placed a portable, petrol driven, pump into the accommodation space, which was located below the main deck of the vessel. \n\nWith both pumps coping with the ingress of water, the skipper manoeuvred the vessel off the mud bank and positioned her alongside the wharf. He then left the vessel to purchase repair materials from a nearby store. Two crew members remained on board to oversee the continuing pumping operation.\n\nWhile the skipper was ashore, the vessel took the bottom and trimmed by the head as the tide ebbed. This resulted in water flowing forward from the accommodation space into an adjacent confined space.\n\nAt this point the pumps in the accommodation space lost suction and the two crew members decided to move the portable, petrol driven, pump into the adjacent confined space.
