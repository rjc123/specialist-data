Her radar echo was acquired and tracked by Humber Vessel Traffic Services (VTS), who made several unsuccessful attempts to establish communications with the unknown contact. A pilot vessel and two tugs were then tasked to investigate. One of the tugs managed to identify the vessel and made fast a tow line to her stern. Dense fog and a strong ebb tide of about 4 knots hindered the efforts of the tug, which could not prevent Fast Ann from making contact with the Immingham Oil Terminal structure.\n\nActions taken:\n\nAcetech Construction Ltd has:\n\n  * Reviewed its procedures on mooring decommissioned vessels.\n  * Submitted proposals to Humber Estuary Services on future securing arrangements.\n  * Invited Humber Estuary Services to inspect securing arrangements.\n  * Undertaken to keep the site manned for the first four high tides following a mooring operation.\n\nHumber Estuary Services has:\n\n  * Reviewed its risk assessment on the hazards of mooring breakouts and, as a result, has introduced further control measures.\n  * Agreed on the feasibility of the proposals submitted by Acetech Construction Ltd and has inspected the site.\n  * Undertaken to review the performance of VTS and the assets deployed so as to take forward any lessons from this accident.\n\nPublished: 22 February 2010\n\n* * *\n"
