Although they had probably not previously planned to do so, the two men decided to take the boat out onto Lower Lough Erne. The weather was overcast with good visibility and the wind was WSW\u2019ly Force 3 which was raising wavelets about 0.3m high; well within the boat\u2019s Category D capabilities. The two men did not wear lifejackets as the owner had left these at home.\n\nThe owner had taken the boat out on several occasions since he had purchased it three months earlier. The planing hull, powered by a 30 HP engine, was capable of carrying 5 people and of achieving around 30 knots in good conditions. The new boat replaced the owner\u2019s previous slower boat, which had been fitted with a cuddy and steering position forward. \n\nThe boat left the mooring around 1130 and proceded through the speed restricted narrows out to the unrestricted waters of Lough Erne. At around 1147, the boat was traveling at almost full speed when it made a sudden turn to starboard, followed by a similar turn to port, during which both men were thrown from the boat.
