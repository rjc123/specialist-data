    "Summary:": "At 1851 (UTC+1) on 28 October 2013, the RoPax ferry Stena Alegra grounded after dragging its anchor in 76 knot winds off Karlskrona, Sweden.\r\r\nThe vessel\u2019s bottom plating and frames were damaged, and one ballast tank and one void space were flooded. Two tugs towed the vessel off the rocks after the weather had moderated the next day. Following an underwater inspection the vessel proceeded to Gdynia, Poland, for repair.\r\r\nThe MAIB investigation identified that the master had decided to anchor the vessel in winds that were forecast to increase to the assumed maximum design limit of its anchoring equipment without completing a full assessment of the consequent risks.\r\r\nThe wind speed rose to above that forecast, causing the vessel to drag its anchor. Measures aimed at arresting the vessel\u2019s drift failed to prevent Stena Alegra from running aground.\r\r\nRecommendations have been made to the vessel\u2019s manager, Northern Marine Management Ltd, to enhance its safety management system requirements for anchoring, including contingency planning, and the enhancement of masters\u2019 handover procedures.\r\r\n\r\r\nReport No 12/2014 | Published 9 May 2014"
