The pilot, who had intended to transfer to Silves from a departing ship, saw that Silves was now committed to entering the channel and instructed the master to continue proceeding inwards.\n\nThe pilot advised the master to follow the leading lights and sent the pilot boat to guide him to the ship\u2019s intended berth. Silves experienced difficulty in following the pilot boat and approached the berth at a larger angle and at a higher speed than was normal. Although the master applied astern propulsion, his action was too late to prevent Silves from making heavy contact with the quay.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the ship\u2019s management company, advising it to improve bridge planning and communications and to ensure its masters are sufficiently experienced in shiphandling.\n\nHe has also written to the port authority, advising it to review its risk assessment and suggesting control measures aimed at preventing a similar accident in the future.\n\nPublished: OCTOBER 2009\n\n* * *\n"
