Approximately 30 minutes into the tour the skipper stopped the vessel at a narrow passage to the south of Ramsey Island, known as Twll-A- Dyllyn (or the Devil\u2019s Hole). This passage between islands is regularly used by local boat trip operators when circumnavigating Ramsey Island. \n\nHaving assessed that the sea conditions were satisfactory, and the crewman having briefed the passengers, the skipper increased speed and commenced his transit through the gap. However, once committed to transiting the passage, a large steep-sided wave appeared, and despite the skipper\u2019s best efforts he was unable to stop the vessel slamming heavily as it dropped off the back of the wave. As it did so, passengers were briefly suspended above their seats before landing heavily back in them. One passenger suffered a shattered vertebra; another, a fractured sternum. The other passengers suffered less serious back injuries and bruising. \n\nThe coastguard was called, and while the crewman attended to the passengers the skipper continued round the island and back to harbour, where the emergency services were waiting.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the MCA highlighting that many of the injury mechanisms from this accident were common with those found by the MAIB during its investigation into the accident involving the RIB, Celtic Pioneer, although the two trips were significantly different.
