On investigation, it was suspected that thermal oil was leaking into the thermal oil heater\u2019s furnace from the heater coils. The thermal oil heater was turned off and its fuel supply isolated, and focus then shifted to switching the ship\u2019s machinery fuel supply from heavy fuel oil to diesel.\n\nA fire then broke out in the thermal oil heater and flames flashed out of the burner air intake igniting lagging and other materials in the engine room. This external fire was extinguished quickly, but the fire inside the heater furnace took much longer to completely extinguish as there was no means of closing off the air intake to the burner; there was no injection point into the furnace for an extinguishing medium; and the thermal oil in the coils could not be drained away as the heater was mounted horizontally.\n\nThe ship\u2019s passengers were mustered during the emergency, but stayed onboard as the fire was contained and under control very quickly.\n\nAction taken:\n\nLloyd\u2019s Register has undertaken to review the rules governing thermal oil heater fire fighting arrangements and to highlight to IACS the issues arising from this accident. \n\nThe Deputy Chief Inspector has written to the ferry managers highlighting the safety issues that have arisen as a result of this accident. \n\nPublished: OCTOBER 2008\n\n* * *\n"
