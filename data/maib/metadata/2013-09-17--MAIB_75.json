    "Summary:": "At approximately 0600  on 17 September 2013, the 13.6m fishing vessel Sally Jane capsized suddenly while beam trawling in Christchurch Bay, England. The vessel\u2019s skipper and mate abandoned the vessel and boarded a liferaft. They were rescued by a lifeboat approximately 2 hours later, during which time Sally Jane had sunk. Both men suffered from mild hypothermia.  \r\r\n\r\r\nThe MAIB investigation identified: \r\r\nSally Jane capsized due to a loss of transverse stability, probably caused by a difference in the weight of the contents of its port and starboard trawl nets.\r\r\nThe uneven loading was most likely due to the contents in the starboard side trawl net breaking free.\r\r\nThe vessel\u2019s heeling moment was exacerbated by the length and angle of the derricks.\r\r\nThe vessel quickly flooded and sank because the hatches to the fish and engine rooms were not secured.\r\r\nThe information in the stability particulars book had not been periodically verified through lightship checks and it was not used by the vessel\u2019s skippers.\r\r\nThe emergency position indicating radio beacon did not activate as it probably became trapped in the starboard trawl net when the vessel capsized, inverted and then sank.\r\r\nNo recommendations have been issued as a consequence of this investigation.\r\r\nReport No 21/2014 | Published 21 August 2014"
