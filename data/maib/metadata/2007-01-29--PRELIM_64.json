No one on the Sea Seeker was keeping a lookout and therefore failed to see the navigation lights of the Pont Menai on their port bow. Meanwhile, the crew of the Pont Menai did not monitor the fishing vessel and thus failed to realise that once Sea Seeker had hauled its net and resumed its passage, the two vessels were on a collision course.\n\nTherefore, with neither vessel maintaining an effective lookout, either visually or by radar, the inevitable occurred and the two vessels collided. \n\nAs a result of the collision the fishing vessel suffered material damage to its bow area which necessitated repairs keeping it from fishing for two weeks, whilst the landing craft received a dent in its starboard side which was repaired and the vessel was able to return to service the following day. \n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Deputy Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the owners of both vessels with respect to: \n\n  * The need to guard against complacency, ensuring that a good lookout is maintained at all times, using all available means. \n\n  * That, when determining if a risk of collision exists, the developing situation must be continually monitored to ensure that effective action can be taken in ample time to avoid collision. \n\n* * *\n"
