A man overboard drill was held involving use of the vessel's Fast Response craft (FRC).   \nThe FRC was lowered to a position 1 metre above the waterline, at this level the crew prepared the boat for entry into the water by cocking the off-load release hook and releasing the safety chain. \n\nLowering was then resumed, whereupon the winch was paid out at full speed and was immediately stopped; this caused the davit assembly to visibly judder, which in turn caused the boat to detach from the hook and drop approximately one metre into the water. The crew were shaken but un harmed. \n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the manager of Integrated Project Team, Which was responsible for overseeing the design and build of the vessel, reminding them of the recommendation made by IMO in MSC/Circ.1094, dated 17 June 2003, relating to the application of Solas regulations concerning Fast Rescue Craft Systems. This states that all parts of the stowage, launch, and recovery system are proven to be compatible well before installation, preferably at the design stage, and are supplied and supported by a single source. \n\nThe Integrated Project Team has reviewed this accident and has initiated modifications to the davit control system to be undertaken by the ship builder. \n\n* * *\n"
