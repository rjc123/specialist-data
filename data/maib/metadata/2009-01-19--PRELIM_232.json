Approximately 2,365 te of packaged timber was lashed on deck.\n\nAs the ship sailed into the North Sea, she encountered strong winds, occasionally up to force 8, but was able to proceed by heading into wind and sea.\n\nJust before leaving the Dover TSS, the wind veered from south to west and increased to force 9, as forecast. Shortly after this, the timber cargo on deck was seen shifting as the vessel rolled to starboard. As the ship rolled back to port, the timber shifted to port and she continued to heel over until it reached 39\u00b0. The cargo lashings then failed and half the deck cargo was lost overboard, after which the ship recovered to a 15\u00b0 list. The ship\u2019s list was reduced further by ballasting before she diverted to Southampton to assess the damage.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the ship\u2019s operators highlighting the safety issues raised by this accident, specifically the requirement to: \n\n  * maximise friction within the stow of timber deck cargo\n\n  * have safe access to tank sounding pipes and over the deck cargo itself \n\n  * conduct adequate stability checks before proceeding to sea.\n\nPublished: FEBRUARY 2009\n\n* * *\n"
