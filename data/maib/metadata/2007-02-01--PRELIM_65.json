The chief officer had been on watch alone, and had fallen asleep around 1\u00bd hours before the vessel impacted the rocky coastline at just under 10 knots, causing extensive damage and flooding to the double bottom. A cargo of 1900 tonnes of Ferro Silicon was embarked, which can emit flammable and toxic gases, when exposed to moisture. Fortunately no water ingress to the hold occurred. \n\nThe local lifeboat, two harbour tugs and the MCA\u2019s Emergency Towing Vessel were deployed to the scene, but the vessel refloated without assistance on the rising tide at around 0650. The harbour tugs then towed the vessel into Lyness, Hoy, where booms were deployed to prevent dispersion of minor pollution from a ruptured diesel tank. \n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the:\n\nNorwegian Maritime Directorate, bringing to their attention a number of issues, in particular: \n\n  * Only the captain and chief officer kept navigational watches, utilising a 6 on, 6 off system, which contributed to the latter\u2019s fatigue; \n\n  * Dedicated lookouts were not being used on the vessel during the hours of darkness contrary to the requirements of STCW; \n\n  * No bridge watch alarm was fitted to the vessel;\n\n  * Poor on board navigational practices; \n\n  * Ship\u2019s operator, strongly advising that it ensures that the issues identified above are addressed on its vessels.\n\n* * *\n"
