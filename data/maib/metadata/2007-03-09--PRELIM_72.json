The operator of the net drum was unable to clearly see the vessel\u2019s stern whilst hauling as his view was impaired due to the physical size of the equipment. He was therefore unaware of the close proximity of the crewman to the net when it was briefly veered back into the sea. \n\nThe nets were quickly recovered, enabling the vessel to be manoeuvred alongside the casualty, who was then able to grab and hold a life ring and be pulled alongside. Sadly, he then began to lose consciousness and, despite the unstinting efforts of the crew, was not able to be revived when he was recovered to the deck. \n\nThe casualty, who was not wearing a flotation aid, was in the water for approximately 15 minutes before final recovery to the deck. \n\nAction taken:\n\nAs a result of the accident the vessel\u2019s owners have: \n\n  * Carried out a review of their working practices and risk assessment; \n\n  * Installed additional net drum controls to enable local operation, with a clear view of the vessel\u2019s stern;\n\n  * Made compulsory the wearing of inflatable lifejackets for all crew working on the open deck; \n\n  * Fitted additional life rings high up on the vessel to allow better deployment. \n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has:\n\n  * Written to the Chief Executive of the Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA) suggesting that he consider extending an initiative for MCA\u2019s surveyors to assist fishermen in their assessment of the risks encountered during fishing operations.\n\n* * *\n"
