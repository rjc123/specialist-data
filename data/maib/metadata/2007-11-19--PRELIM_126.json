None of the contractors can recall a safety brief being given.\n\nThe St Mary\u2019s Jet Boat Services (SMJBS) workboat Wizard was contracted to undertake the trip on 19 November. The skipper held the MCA\u2019s Boatmaster's Tier 1, Level 2 Licence as well as the Council of the Isles of Scilly Boatman\u2019s Licence, which was granted following a local knowledge assessment which was carried out in daylight only. \n\nAt 0520 on 19 November Wizard left St Mary\u2019s Quay for Porth Conger with the skipper and six contractors on board. The radar was set on the \u00bd mile range scale. A track was selected for Porth Conger from the GPS track plotter which was set on the 500 ft display. The weather was fine but overcast and very dark, there was a force 3/4 wind from the north-west and it was low water. \n\nAs usual the skipper used the leading lights for Hugh Town on leaving St Mary\u2019s Quay and then headed towards Bartholomew Buoy and Beacon.

As the boat approached the Calf the skipper felt uneasy about his position and reduced his speed to about 15 \u2013 18 knots. Almost immediately, at about 0528, Wizard grounded on the Calf and the boat was left hanging off the rock.\n\nThe skipper was thrown forward cutting his head on the window wiper motor.
