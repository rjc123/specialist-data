Simultaneously, the crew of a fire tender berthed at Lambeth pier observed that Mistress Quickly was in difficulty, and proceeded to assist. As the fire tender was securing alongside, Mistress Quickly\u2019s captain observed smoke and sparks coming from the engine compartment. The crewman moved the passengers to the rear of the vessel while the captain isolated the main diesel supply line and closed one flap on the engine compartment.
