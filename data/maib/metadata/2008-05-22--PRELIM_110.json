The tow was progressing slowly due to shearing exacerbated by the inability to control Germania\u2019s rudder.\n\nA tow wire protector or \u201cchafer\u201d was being used on Englishman to prevent the wire chafing on the bulwark rail. The \u201cchafer\u201d was not fixed to the wire, but had a shackle at either end, connected by a length of chain with a rope tied off at the winch, to try to prevent the \u201cchafer\u201d from sliding along the wire and off the rail. \n\nAt around 0240 UTC, the \u201cchafer\u201d slipped outboard of the bulwark rail, and the bosun went alone onto the working deck to re-position it back onto the rail. The \u201cchafer\u201d was initially pulled inboard of the rail and, as the tug was manoeuvred to dip the starboard quarter to allow the \u201cchafer\u201d to be pushed back into position, the aft shackle on the \u201cchafer\u201d arrangement became caught on a bracket on the vessel\u2019s stern bulwark rail. As the bracket bent, the shackle freed itself, and the tow wire jumped around a metre to starboard. Although not witnessed, due to visibility constraints from the wheelhouse, part of the towing arrangement struck the bosun, who received fatal head injuries.\n\nAction taken:\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to:\n\n  * SMS Towage Ltd, acknowledging the various modifications being made to Englishman following the accident, including modifications to: the \u201cNorman Pin\u201d sockets on the stern bulwark rail; the on board communication system; the aft deck lighting and the introduction of a CCTV system. The company was strongly advised to undertake a review of the risk assessments for its vessels to ensure they are vessel specific and consider in detail the towing operation's, these risk assessments should be regularly reviewed. \n\n  * British Tugowners Association and the National Workboat Association, requesting that the issues identified following this accident are disseminated to their members, and consideration is given to the development of an industry-wide guide to best practice in towage. \n\nPublished: JULY 2008\n\n* * *\n"
