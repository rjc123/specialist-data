There is clear evidence that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (ie, alendronic acid, ibandronic acid, and risedronate) can cause oesophageal irritation and reactions. After reports of oesophageal cancer in association with oral bisphosphonates, we collaborated with the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford to conduct a study to assess this issue.[^1]\n\nThe results from this study suggest a small increase in the risk of oesophageal cancer in patients who had taken oral bisphosphonates for more than 5 years compared with a group who had not taken oral bisphosphonates. The incidence rate of oesophageal cancer over 5 years in men and women aged 60–79 years in the general population is 0.5 women per 1000 and 1.5 men per 1000.
