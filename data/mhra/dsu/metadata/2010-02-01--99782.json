It exerts its therapeutic activity in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine by preventing the gastric and pancreatic lipases from hydrolysing dietary fat, in the form of triglycerides, into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides.\n\nOrlistat is available in Europe as 120 mg capsules under the brand name Xenical, and as 60 mg capsules under the brand name alli, for weight loss in combination with a reduced-calorie, lower-fat diet.

Pharmacists should be aware of this information so that they can appropriately advise consumers who wish to buy alli or discuss its use.\n\nOxalate nephropathy  \nPatients with kidney disease should consult a doctor before starting alli because use of orlistat could rarely (≥1/10 000 to <1/1000) lead to hyperoxaluria and oxalate nephropathy.\n\nInteraction with levothyroxine  \nPatients who are taking levothyroxine should consult a doctor before starting alli because reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur when alli and levothyroxine are taken at the same time. This could be due to decreased absorption of iodine salts or levothyroxine (or both).
