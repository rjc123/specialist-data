  "body": "Article date: January 2010\n\nThe European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has [reviewed the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) with gadolinium-containing contrast agents](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2009/11/news_detail_000408.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1&murl=menus/news_and_events/news_and_events.jsp&jsenabled=true).\n\nOn the basis of current evidence, the risk classification is as follows:  \n  \n  * High risk—Omniscan (gadodiamide), OptiMARK (gadoversetamide), Magnevist (gadopentetic acid)  \n  * Medium risk—MultiHance (gadobenic acid), Primovist (gadoxetic acid), Vasovist (gadofosveset)  \n  * Low risk—Gadovist (gadobutrol), ProHance (gadoteridol), Dotarem (gadoteric acid)  \n  \n## Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis\n\nNSF, previously called nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD), is a serious and life-threatening condition characterised by the formation of connective tissue in the skin which becomes thickened, coarse, and hard, sometimes leading to contractures and joint immobility. Patients with NSF can have systemic involvement of other organs including the lungs, liver, muscles, and heart.\n\nNine gadolinium-containing contrast agents are authorised in the EU to aid MRI of the body and of the blood vessels (magnetic resonance angiography, MRA)—see above.\n\nThe risk of NSF with these agents has been kept under close review since the association was first observed in January 2006.[^1] In [August 2007, Drug Safety Update advised](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/ssLINK/CON079095) healthcare professionals that the risk of NSF was highest with Omniscan and OptiMARK, and that there was also evidence to suggest that Magnevist should not be used in patients at greater risk (ie, those with severe renal dysfunction).\n\nIn the recent review, the CHMP has considered: the risk of NSF in patients with renal impairment; risk in patients in the perioperative liver-transplantation period; use in infants, neonates, and the elderly; use during pregnancy and lactation; the need for screening of renal function before use and dose restrictions; measures to accurately record the agent used; and what further studies are required.\n\nAdvice for healthcare professionals:\n\nThe following risk-minimisation measures should be used for gadolinium-containing contrast agents:\n\nRenal-function monitoring\n\nRenal function should be tested in all patients receiving high-risk agents, and is generally advisable for patients receiving medium-risk or low-risk agents. It is particularly important to screen patients aged 65 years or older\n\nRenal impairment\n\nFor patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <30 mL/min/1·73m2), use of a high-risk agent is contraindicated. If use of a medium-risk agent cannot be avoided or if it is necessary to use a low-risk agent, a single lowest dose possible can be used and should not be repeated for at least 7 days\n\nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30–59 mL/min/1·73 m2), if it is necessary to use a high-risk agent a single lowest dose possible can be used and should not be repeated for at least 7 days\n\nPerioperative liver-transplantation period\n\nUse of a high-risk agent is contraindicated. If use of a medium-risk agent cannot be avoided or if it is necessary to use a low-risk agent, a single lowest dose possible can be used and should not be repeated for at least 7 days\n\nNeonates\n\nUse of a high-risk agent is contraindicated. For medium-risk or low-risk agents, use a single lowest possible dose and do not repeat for at least 7 days\n\nInfants\n\nUse a single lowest dose of agent possible and do not repeat for at least 7 days\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nDiscontinue for at least 24 hours after use of a high-risk agent. The decision of whether to continue or suspend breastfeeding for 24 hours after use of a medium-risk or low-risk agent should be at your discretion in consultation with the mother\n\nPregnancy\n\nUse of any gadolinium-containing contrast agent is not recommended unless absolutely necessary\n\nHaemodialysis\n\nThere is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis\n\nRecording of the agent used\n\nWhen they become available, peel-off tracking labels found on the vials, syringes, or bottles should be stuck onto the patient record to accurately record the name of the gadolinium contrast agent used.
