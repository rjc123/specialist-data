  "body": "Article date: June 2011\n\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) in association with use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) is not a new issue. For a given dose of oestrogen, the absolute incidence of VTE varies according to the type of progestogen in the pill but is, for all COCs, very small.\n\nThe incidence of VTE in association with the use of levonorgestrel-containing, desogestrel-containing, or gestodene-containing pills has been studied extensively. Overall, these studies have shown that women who use pills that contain desogestrel or gestodene have a slightly higher risk of developing VTE than do those who use levonorgestrel-containing pills. The excess risk of VTE is highest during the first year a woman ever starts or switches their COC.\n\nYasmin contains drospirenone, a relatively new progestogen, and was first licensed in 2000. Evidence of the level of VTE risk associated with Yasmin has been accruing since then. The results of two early prospective cohort studies suggested no difference in risk of VTE between Yasmin and levonorgestrel-containing pills[^1] or ‘other’ COCs. [^2] However, in 2009, a Danish cohort study [^3] and a Dutch case-control study [^4] of the risk of VTE in association with a number of COCs found the risk with drospirenone-containing pills to be higher than the risk associated with levonorgestrel-containing pills. Two further studies were recently published: one using the US PharMetrics database [^5] and the other using the UK General Practice Research Database. [^6] Both corroborated the findings of the Danish 3 and Dutch4 studies of an increased risk of VTE in association with use of drospirenone-containing pills relative to levonorgestrel-containing pills.\n\nRecent unpublished re-analyses of data from the Danish study3 directly compared VTE risk for drospirenone-containing pills, levonorgestrel-containing pills, and desogestrel/gestodene-containing pills.
