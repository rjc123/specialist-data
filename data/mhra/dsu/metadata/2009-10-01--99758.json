  "body": "Article date: October 2009\n\nA study has recently been published which used the General Practice Research Database to determine whether varenicline▼ may be associated with an increased risk of suicide and suicidal behaviour compared with bupropion or nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT). This nested cohort study analysed 80 660 people prescribed a new course of smoking-cessation product between Sept 1, 2006 and May 31, 2008.\n\nSee Gunnell D, et al. BMJ 2009; 339: b3805.\n\nThe study found no clear evidence that varenicline was associated with an increased risk of fatal or non-fatal self-harm, although a two-fold increased risk cannot be ruled out on the basis of the upper 95% CI. Compared with NRT, the hazard ratio for self-harm in people prescribed varenicline was 1·12 (95% CI 0·67–1·88), and was 1·17 (0·59–2·32) for those prescribed bupropion. There was no evidence that varenicline was associated with increased risk of depression (0·88 [0·77–1·00]) or suicidal thoughts (1·43 [0·53–3·85]).\n\nAs with all medicines, the MHRA will continue to closely monitor the safety of varenicline.
