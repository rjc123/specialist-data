Phenytoin is one of the most common causes of antiepileptic-related cutaneous adverse reactions, including life-threatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).[^1] A recent study [^2] has shown a significant association between the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele HLA-B*1502 and phenytoin-induced SJS in patients of Thai or Han Chinese ethnic origin.\n\nHealthcare professionals should be aware of the risk of SJS in patients of Thai or Han Chinese ethnic origin and the association with HLA-B*1502 genetic variant when prescribing phenytoin. In these individuals with increased susceptibility, phenytoin should be avoided when alternative therapy can be given. However, available data are too limited to recommend screening of patients of Thai or Chinese ethnic origin for presence of the HLA-B*1502 allele before starting phenytoin treatment.\n\n## Further information on the recent study\n\nLocharernkul and co-workers’2 study included ten patients of Thai ethnic origin who had epilepsy and SJS induced by antiepileptic treatment; all tested positive for HLA-B*1502 and had only been taking a single medicine.
