  "body": "Article date: August 2009\n\nHealthcare professionals will often encounter patients who are taking herbal medicines. However, many patients are reluctant to inform their healthcare professional, so enquiry is important. Research commissioned by the MHRA indicated that approximately a third of UK adults had used herbal medicines. These products have the potential to cause adverse reactions as well as interact with conventional medicines.\n\nWe are responsible for monitoring the safety of herbal medicines in the UK and to do this we use many of the same tools that are used to monitor conventional medicines. Furthermore, the Herbal Medicines Advisory Committee advises the MHRA on the safety and quality of herbal medicinal products for human use.\n\nKey areas of concern about herbal medicines include:  \n  \n  * poor and variable quality of unlicensed or unregulated products  \n  * deliberate adulteration with potentially toxic ingredients such as heavy metals, arsenic, and prescription-only medicines (including products that have been banned because of safety concerns)  \n  * lack of detailed product information  \n  \nAfter international case reports of liver damage, we have recently issued warnings in conjunction with the Food Standards Agency about [Hydroxycut](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Herbalmedicines/HerbalSafetyNews/Currentsafetyissues/CON046623) (a weight-loss supplement) and [Fortodol](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Herbalmedicines/HerbalSafetyNews/Currentsafetyissues/CON041393) (also sold as Miradin, a turmeric-based food supplement, often promoted with unsubstantiated medicinal claims).\n\n## Regulated herbal medicines\n\nThere is an increasing range of herbal medicines with a traditional herbal registration (shown by a THR number on the packaging) coming onto the UK market. We have assessed safety, quality, and patient information for these products. The permitted minor indications are based on evidence of traditional use and not proven efficacy. There are also some herbal medicines with a product licence (shown by a PL number) which are accompanied by necessary information for safe use.\n\nDetails of the Summary of Product Characteristics and patient leaflets for products registered under the THR scheme are available [on our website](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Publications/PublicAssessmentReports/PublicAssessmentReportsforherbalmedicines/index.htm).\n\n## The Yellow Card Scheme\n\nThe [Yellow Card Scheme](http://www.yellowcard.gov.uk/) collects reports of suspected adverse reactions and is a valuable tool when trying to identify new safety issues for medicinal products, including herbals.

However, we would appreciate it if you could provide some extra details, particularly as much information as possible about the herbal product suspected to be involved, such as:  \n  \n  * the brand name (if it has one)  \n  * the list of ingredients  \n  * ideally, a copy of package labelling  \n  * details of the manufacturer  \n  \nWe ask for these details because there are numerous products that are sold using the botanical name such as “Echinacea”; however these products can differ depending on the formulation or the species involved, and may be associated with different side-effect profiles.
