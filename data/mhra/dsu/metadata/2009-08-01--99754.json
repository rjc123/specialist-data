  "body": "Article date: August 2009\n\nThe MHRA is very aware of the need to monitor the impact of the actions we take on medicines, whether these result in a widening or restriction of access. It is important for us to ensure that our decisions have a positive outcome for users of medicines.\n\nOur commitment to this important area of research is outlined in our current [business plan](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Publications/Corporate/BusinessPlans/index.htm).This article outlines how we try to ensure we optimally safeguard public health by: conducting our own research; working collaboratively with academic groups and other agencies; commissioning research; and requesting specific research from the pharmaceutical industry (marketing authorisation holders) where appropriate.\n\n## MHRA research\n\nWe perform studies to provide better information on the pattern of usage of medicines to inform decisions we are about to make; or to examine the impact of regulatory action that has been taken. For example, we might need to identify patterns of use for established medicines before reclassification of a product from prescription-only to pharmacy supply; to examine patterns of use after regulatory action; or assess usage of other medicines in the event of a drug withdrawal.\n\nWe also carry out studies to investigate potential new safety issues using databases such as the [General Practice Research Database](http://www.gprd.com/).\n\n## Commissioned research programme\n\nIn April 2005, we announced a [call for research proposals](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/ssLINK/CON2030212) to study the safety of medicines. As a result, the following studies were commissioned:  \n  \n  * The safety of antiepileptic drugs in children (London School of Pharmacy)  \n  \nThis study specifically looked at the safety of newer antiepileptics compared with the more-established drugs in children, and did not identify any specific safety concerns. This study was presented at the European Society for Developmental Perinatal and Paediatric Pharmacology, Rotterdam 2008, and the International Conference of Pharmacoepidemiology, Copenhagen 2008.  \n  \n  * The impact of regulatory action taken by the MHRA on COX-2 inhibitors[^1] and SSRIs [^2] [^3](University of Bristol)   \n  \nThe COX-2 study aimed to investigate the effects of withdrawal and regulatory advice for COX-2 inhibitors on UK rates of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and acute myocardial infarction. It found that such action did not appear to have any adverse effect on population health and may have been beneficial.\n\nThe SSRI studies analysed whether the restriction of the use of SSRIs in children and adolescents had lead to an increased risk of suicide in these age-groups, and found that there was no evidence that this had occurred.  \n  \n  * The use of the General Practice Research Database to provide earlier information on the safety of drug use in children before conducting a trial (Queen Mary and Westfields College London, study ongoing)  \n  \nIt is hoped that a preliminary study using this database could help researchers plan their trial specifically for the target population.\n\n## Collaborative work\n\nWe also work collaboratively with external academic groups or other government agencies (such as the [Health Protection Agency](http://www.hpa.org.uk/)) to carry out studies of mutual interest. Examples of such collaborations include:  \n  \n  * University of Bristol—risk of suicidal behaviour related to antidepressants[^4] and smoking-cessation therapies (submitted for publication)   \n  \nThis antidepressant study4 found no evidence that the risk of suicide or non-fatal self-harm in adults prescribed SSRIs was greater than in those prescribed tricyclic antidepressants. Weak evidence was found for an increased risk for current SSRI use in those age 18 years or younger. However, a bias of preferential SSRI prescribing to patients at higher risk of suicidal behaviour cannot be ruled out.  \n  \n  * Health Protection Agency—risks of Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bell’s palsy after influenza vaccination[^5] [^6]  \n  \nThese studies found no evidence of increased risk.\n\nUniversity of Oxford, Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit—GP prescribing trends in HRT, tibolone, and bisphosphonates between 1991 and 2005 for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in relation to published research on health effects of these medicines and changes to prescribing advice[^7]\n\nThe study found that prescribing of HRT had fallen by about 50% since 2002, which reflected new epidemiological evidence and prescribing advice.
