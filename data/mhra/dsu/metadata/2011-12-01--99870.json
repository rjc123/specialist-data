It is licensed for primary prevention of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events in adults who have had elective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery (dose 220 mg/day), and for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (SSE) in adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and one or more cardiovascular risk factors (dose 300 mg/day).

A dose reduction and close clinical surveillance should be considered in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30&#8211;50 mL/min), particularly in those at increased risk of bleeding.

  "body": "Article date: December 2011\n\nDabigatran (Pradaxa▼) is a reversible inhibitor of free thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. It is licensed for primary prevention of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events in adults who have had elective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery (dose 220 mg/day), and for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (SSE) in adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and one or more cardiovascular risk factors (dose 300 mg/day). Dabigatran has a rapid onset of action and does not require therapeutic monitoring. It is eliminated unchanged in urine. Exposure to dabigatran is substantially increased in patients with renal insufficiency.\n\n## Haemorrhage is a well recognised and common adverse reaction with dabigatran\n\nTo minimise the risk of bleeding, dabigatran is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance, <30 mL/min). A dose reduction and close clinical surveillance should be considered in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–50 mL/min), particularly in those at increased risk of bleeding. Similar precautions are recommended for patients older than 75 years (for more specific details see Summary of Product Characteristics, available via [the electronic Medicines Compendium](http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/)).\n\nThere is no specific antidote to dabigatran, and excessive anticoagulation may require interruption of treatment. In the event of haemorrhagic complications, treatment must be discontinued and the source of the bleeding investigated; adequate diuresis must be maintained.\n\n## Case reports of fatal haemorrhage in Japan\n\nThe receipt of a number of case reports of fatal haemorrhage in patients who received dabigatran for SSE in Japan has resulted in a strengthening of the advice for prescribers. All patients were reported to be older than 75 years, with renal impairment and additional risk factors for bleeding, including concomitant medication.
