The effects of cilostazol include antiplatelet activity and vasodilation.\n\nA review of the benefits and risks of cilostazol was triggered by reports of adverse reactions (mainly cardiac and haemorrhagic), and by the potential for drug interactions.\n\n### Efficacy of cilostazol\n\nIn clinical trials, cilostazol provided an average improvement in maximum walking distance of 87 m (approximately 66% increase) compared with 44 m for placebo; average baseline walking distance was 133 m.
