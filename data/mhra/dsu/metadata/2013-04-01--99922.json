The effects of cilostazol include antiplatelet activity and vasodilation.\n\nA review of the benefits and risks of cilostazol was triggered by reports of adverse reactions (mainly cardiac and haemorrhagic), and by the potential for drug interactions.\n\n### Efficacy of cilostazol\n\nIn clinical trials, cilostazol provided an average improvement in maximum walking distance of 87 m (approximately 66% increase) compared with 44 m for placebo; average baseline walking distance was 133 m. The studies measured walking distance using a graded treadmill test, and therefore the actual improvement on flat ground is expected to be greater.\n\n### Safety review of cilostazol\n\nSafety data from the efficacy trials and a phase IV long-term safety study ([CASTLE](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521407016096)) were reviewed. The most commonly reported reactions were relatively minor (headaches, diarrhoea, palpitations, dizziness), and the clinical trials did not raise serious safety concerns.
