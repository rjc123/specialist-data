  "body": "Article date: December 2009\n\nFinasteride is an inhibitor of type II 5α-reductase, an enzyme that metabolises testosterone into the more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), resulting in a reduction in DHT concentrations in serum and target tissues. 5 mg finasteride (Proscar) is used for the treatment and control of benign prostatic hyperplasia because enlargement of the prostate gland is dependent on conversion of testosterone to DHT. Finasteride can also reduce scalp and serum DHT concentrations, and the 1 mg dose (Propecia) is indicated for the treatment of men with androgenetic alopecia to increase hair growth and prevent further hair loss.\n\nUp to November 2009, 50 cases of male breast cancer have been reported worldwide with 5 mg finasteride and three cases with the 1 mg dose. Overall, the incidence of male breast cancer in clinical trials for 5 mg finasteride was not significantly increased: 7·8 per 100 000 patient-years (95% CI 3·7–16·4) for patients exposed to finasteride for more than 1 year compared with 3·8 per 100 000 patient-years (1·2–11·9) for those not exposed to finasteride.  \n   \nThe mechanism of action of finasteride (inhibition of type II 5α-reductase) leads to decreases in DHT levels that are accompanied by increases in testosterone and oestradiol levels.
