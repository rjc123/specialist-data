The review has recommended strengthened advice to ensure correct prescribing and administration, and early detection and effective management of hypersensitivity reactions.</p>\n\n<h3>Further information on hypersensitivity reactions</h3>\n\n<p>Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including life-threatening and fatal anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions, have been reported in patients receiving IV iron. These reactions can occur even when a previous administration has been tolerated (including a negative test dose). Caution is therefore needed with <u>every</u> dose of IV iron, even if previous administrations have been well tolerated.</p>\n\n<p>The product should be given in accordance with the specific posology and method of administration stated in the product information. IV iron should only be given in an environment where the patient can be adequately monitored, and where resuscitation facilities are available.

Later in pregnancy, any benefits of using IV iron should be carefully weighed against the risks: anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions could have serious consequences for both mother and foetus.</p>\n\n<h3>Test dose</h3>\n\n<p>Previously, an initial test dose has been recommended for some IV iron products before administration of the first dose to a new patient. However, there are no clear data that an initial test dose minimises risk: conversely, it may give false reassurance because hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients that had a negative initial test dose. Therefore, an initial test dose on first use of an IV iron product for a patient is no longer recommended. All references to this recommendation will be removed from relevant product information.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that the advice for administration of a product remains otherwise unchanged.

  "body": "Article date: August 2013\n\nIntravenous (IV) iron products are indicated in the treatment of iron deficiency and anaemia when iron supplements cannot be given or have not worked. Hypersensitivity reactions are well known to occur rarely with IV iron products, and may be life-threatening or fatal. Warnings about this risk are given in the product information.\n\n### European review\n\nA European review of IV iron products has taken place after concerns in France about the risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, especially in pregnant women. The review has recommended strengthened advice to ensure correct prescribing and administration, and early detection and effective management of hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n### Further information on hypersensitivity reactions\n\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including life-threatening and fatal anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions, have been reported in patients receiving IV iron. These reactions can occur even when a previous administration has been tolerated (including a negative test dose). Caution is therefore needed with every dose of IV iron, even if previous administrations have been well tolerated.\n\nThe product should be given in accordance with the specific posology and method of administration stated in the product information. IV iron should only be given in an environment where the patient can be adequately monitored, and where resuscitation facilities are available.
