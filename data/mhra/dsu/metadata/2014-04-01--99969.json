The TNF-alpha inhibitors authorised in the UK are adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab. TNF-alpha inhibitors are authorised for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitits, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis.\n\nIncreased risk of tuberculosis\n\nTNF-alpha plays an important role in inflammatory processes, and is involved in autoimmune diseases, and immune responses to infection. TNF-alpha inhibition increases susceptibility to infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, and increases the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis. An increased risk of tuberculosis in patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors has been confirmed in large observational studies.
