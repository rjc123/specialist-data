  "body": "Article date: March 2009\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has completed a review of the benefits and risks of methylphenidate after recent concerns about its cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and psychiatric safety and its long-term effects.\n\nThe EMEA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use concluded that on the basis of currently available data, the benefits of methylphenidate continue to outweigh the risks when used in its licensed indication. Methylphenidate is indicated as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children aged 6 years or older and adolescents, who are diagnosed according to [DSM-IV criteria](http://www.psychiatryonline.com/) or [guidelines in ICD-10](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm) and when remedial measures alone are insufficient.\n\n[European Medicines Agency makes recommendations for safer use of Ritalin and other methylphenidate-containing medicines in the EU](http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Press_release/2009/11/WC500014589.pdf)\n\n[Questions and answers on the review of medicines containing methylphenidate](http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Referrals_document/Methylphenidate_31/WC500011125.pdf)\n\n[Elements recommended for inclusion in Summaries of Product Characteristics for methylphenidate-containing medicinal products authorised for the treatment of ADHD in children aged six years and above and adolescents](http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Referrals_document/Methylphenidate_31/WC500011184.pdf)\n\nFor further information on brands of methylphenidate available in the UK, see the [British National Formulary (BNF)](http://bnf.org/bnf/index.htm).\n\nKey safety information and advice for healthcare professionals:\n\nContraindications—methylphenidate should not be used in patients with:  \n  \n  * Diagnosis or history of severe depression, anorexia nervosa or anorexic disorders, suicidal tendencies, psychotic symptoms, mania, schizophrenia, severe mood disorders, or psychopathic or borderline personality disorder  \n  * Diagnosis or history of severe and episodic (type I) bipolar (affective) disorder that is not well-controlled  \n  * Pre-existing cerebrovascular disorders—eg, cerebral aneurysm and vascular abnormalities, including vasculitis or stroke  \n  * Unless specialist cardiac advice has been obtained: in pre-existing cardiovascular disorders, including severe hypertension, heart failure, arterial occlusive disease, angina, haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, myocardial infarction, potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, and dysfunction of cardiac ion channels  \n  \nPretreatment screening  \n  \n  * Before prescribing, the patient’s baseline cardiovascular status, including blood pressure and heart rate, should be assessed  \n  * A complete history should be taken, documenting: concomitant medicines; past and present medical and psychiatric disorders or symptoms; family history of sudden cardiac death, unexplained death, or malignant arrhythmia; and accurate pretreatment height and weight on a growth chart.
