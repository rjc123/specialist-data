This restricted indication is due to reports of pigment changes.\n\n### Risk of pigment changes\n\nPigment changes (ie, discolouration) of ocular tissue—including the retina—have been reported in two long-term clinical studies of retigabine and a compassionate use programme. These studies also observed blue-grey discolouration of the nails, lips, or skin. These reports are considered to be very common (ie, occurring in ≥1/10 patients) after prolonged retigabine treatment.\n\nFrom these studies, 55 patients had eye examination up to May 2, 2013; baseline eye assessments were not done. 21 patients had pigment changes in ocular tissue—15 of which involved the retina.

It is currently unclear whether the ocular pigmentation can result in decreased visual function.\n\nUp to May 2013, 51 events relating to pigmentation of the nails, lips, or skin after retigabine treatment have been reported from the studies or programme. Median time to onset was 4.4 years (range 4 months to 6.7 years). Events tended to occur at high doses (usually ≥900 mg a day), although some occurred at lower doses; there seems to be no relation with age or sex.\n\nThe cause, natural history, and long-term prognosis of the pigment changes are currently unknown, and further investigations are ongoing.\n\nAdvice for healthcare professionals:  \n  \n  * Patients who are currently receiving retigabine treatment should be reviewed at a routine (non-urgent) appointment.
