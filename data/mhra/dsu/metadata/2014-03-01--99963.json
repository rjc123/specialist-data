  "body": "Article date: March 2014\n\nOrlistat is indicated for weight loss in combination with a low-calorie, low-fat diet. It is available as 120 mg capsules under the brand name Xenical and as 60 mg capsules under the brand name alli. Xenical is only available with a prescription, whereas alli is available without a prescription under the supervision of a pharmacist.\n\nOrlistat is a potent, specific, and long-acting inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases which decreases the amount of fat absorbed from the diet.\n\nOn the basis of reports from literature[^1] [^2]and data obtained after licensing, orlistat may theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medicines. This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time.
