Furthermore, a licensed medicine: has been assessed for efficacy, safety, and quality; has been manufactured to appropriate quality standards; and when placed on the market is accompanied by appropriate product information and labelling.\n\n## Prescribing in a patient’s best interests\n\nHowever, there are clinical situations when the use of unlicensed medicines or use of medicines outside the terms of the licence (ie, ‘off-label’) may be judged by the prescriber to be in the best interest of the patient on the basis of available evidence. Such practice is particularly common in certain areas of medicine: for instance, in paediatrics where difficulties in the development of age-appropriate formulations means that many medicines used in children are used off-label or are unlicensed.\n\n[Read more about medicines for children on the medicines for childrens section of the website](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Medicinesforchildren/index.htm)\n\nSee also [Drug Safety Update January](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/ssLINK/CON088149) [2009](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/ssLINK/CON088149)\n\nHealthcare professionals may regard it necessary to prescribe or advise on the use of an unlicensed medicine (ie, through the so-called ‘specials’ regime when no licensed suitable alternative is available, or when a medicine is prepared in a pharmacy by, or under the supervision of, a pharmacist), or the use of a licensed medicine outside the terms defined by the licence (eg, outside defined indications, doses, routes of administration, or contrary to listed warnings).\n\n## In practice\n\nAt present, the following healthcare professionals can prescribe an unlicensed medicine: doctors; dentists; and, in some circumstances, supplementary prescribers (who can be a pharmacist, nurse, midwife, community nurse, optometrist, physiotherapist, radiographer, or chiropodist/podiatrist).

Prescribers should consider use of this licensed thalidomide product first. Use of the licensed thalidomide product is important because pregnancy-prevention measures are linked to the prescription and dispensing of the authorised formulation, but not to those that are unlicensed.\n\nAdvice for prescribers:\n\nConsider…  \n  \n  * Before prescribing an unlicensed medicine, be satisfied that an alternative, licensed medicine would not meet the patient’s needs  \n  * Before prescribing a medicine off-label, be satisfied that such use would better serve the patient’s needs than an appropriately licensed alternative  \n  * Before prescribing an unlicensed medicine or using a medicine off-label:  \n\\- be satisfied that there is a sufficient evidence base and/or experience of using the medicine to show its safety and efficacy  \n\\- take responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patient’s care, including monitoring and follow-up  \n\\- record the medicine prescribed and, where common practice is not being followed, the reasons for prescribing this medicine; you may wish to record that you have discussed the issue with the patient  \n  \nCommunicate: best practice is that…  \n  \n  * You give patients, or those authorising treatment on their behalf, sufficient information about the proposed treatment, including known serious or common adverse reactions, to enable them to make an informed decision  \n  * Where current practice supports the use of a medicine outside the terms of its licence, it may not be necessary to draw attention to the licence when seeking consent. However, it is good practice to give as much information as patients or carers require or which they may see as relevant  \n  * You explain the reasons for prescribing a medicine off-label or prescribing an unlicensed medicine where there is little evidence to support its use, or where the use of a medicine is innovative  \n  \nReport suspected adverse reactions…  \n  \n  * Healthcare professionals have a responsibility to help monitor the safety of medicines in clinical use through submission of suspected adverse drug reactions to the MHRA and CHM via the [Yellow Card Scheme](http://www.yellowcard.gov.uk/). Such reporting is equally important for unlicensed medicines or those used off-label as for those that are licensed  \n  \nGuidance\n\n[General Medical Council Good Practice in Prescribing Medicines (September 2008)](http://www.gmc-uk.org/static/documents/content/Good_Practice_in_Prescribing_Medicines_0911.pdf)\n\n[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain Pharmacist Prescriber's Pack](http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/worldofpharmacy)\n\n[Nursing and Midwifery Council standards of proficiency for nurse and midwife prescribers (April 2006)](http://www.nmc-uk.org/Educators/Standards-for-education/Standards-of-proficiency-for-nurse-and-midwife-prescribers/)\n\n[Health Professions Council](http://www.hpc-uk.org/)\n\n[General Dental Council](http://www.gdc-uk.org/Our+work/Standards/)\n\n[Department of Health, Medicine Matters (July 2006)](http://http//www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_064325)\n\nFurther information\n\nMHRA\n\n[Drug Safety Update](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/drugsafetyupdate) brings you the latest information about changes to prescribing information to support safer use of medicines\n\n[Review of unlicensed medicines](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Reviewofunlicensedmedicines/index.htm)\n\n[Importation of unlicensed medicines](http://http//www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Importingandexportingmedicines/Importingunlicensedmedicines/index.htm)\n\nConsent\n\n[Key documents from the Department of Health](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Scientificdevelopmentgeneticsandbioethics/Consent/Consentgeneralinformation/index.htm)\n\n[British National FormularyBritish National Formulary](http://www.bnf.org.uk/)\n\n[British National Formulary for ChildrenBritish National Formulary for Children](http://www.bnf.org/bnf/org_450055.htm)\n\n[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child HealthRoyal College of Paediatrics and Child Health](http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/)\n\n \n\nArticle citation: Drug Safety Update April 2009, vol 2 issue 9: 6.\n"
