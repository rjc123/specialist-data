Prescribers should consider use of this licensed thalidomide product first. Use of the licensed thalidomide product is important because pregnancy-prevention measures are linked to the prescription and dispensing of the authorised formulation, but not to those that are unlicensed.\n\nAdvice for prescribers:\n\nConsiderâ€¦  \n  \n  * Before prescribing an unlicensed medicine, be satisfied that an alternative, licensed medicine would not meet the patientâ€™s needs  \n  * Before prescribing a medicine off-label, be satisfied that such use would better serve the patientâ€™s needs than an appropriately licensed alternative  \n  * Before prescribing an unlicensed medicine or using a medicine off-label:  \n\\- be satisfied that there is a sufficient evidence base and/or experience of using the medicine to show its safety and efficacy  \n\\- take responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patientâ€™s care, including monitoring and follow-up  \n\\- record the medicine prescribed and, where common practice is not being followed, the reasons for prescribing this medicine; you may wish to record that you have discussed the issue with the patient  \n  \nCommunicate: best practice is thatâ€¦  \n  \n  * You give patients, or those authorising treatment on their behalf, sufficient information about the proposed treatment, including known serious or common adverse reactions, to enable them to make an informed decision  \n  * Where current practice supports the use of a medicine outside the terms of its licence, it may not be necessary to draw attention to the licence when seeking consent. However, it is good practice to give as much information as patients or carers require or which they may see as relevant  \n  * You explain the reasons for prescribing a medicine off-label or prescribing an unlicensed medicine where there is little evidence to support its use, or where the use of a medicine is innovative  \n  \nReport suspected adverse reactionsâ€¦  \n  \n  * Healthcare professionals have a responsibility to help monitor the safety of medicines in clinical use through submission of suspected adverse drug reactions to the MHRA and CHM via the [Yellow Card Scheme](http://www.yellowcard.gov.uk/). Such reporting is equally important for unlicensed medicines or those used off-label as for those that are licensed  \n  \nGuidance\n\n[General Medical Council Good Practice in Prescribing Medicines (September 2008)](http://www.gmc-uk.org/static/documents/content/Good_Practice_in_Prescribing_Medicines_0911.pdf)\n\n[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain Pharmacist Prescriber's Pack](http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/worldofpharmacy)\n\n[Nursing and Midwifery Council standards of proficiency for nurse and midwife prescribers (April 2006)](http://www.nmc-uk.org/Educators/Standards-for-education/Standards-of-proficiency-for-nurse-and-midwife-prescribers/)\n\n[Health Professions Council](http://www.hpc-uk.org/)\n\n[General Dental Council](http://www.gdc-uk.org/Our+work/Standards/)\n\n[Department of Health, Medicine Matters (July 2006)](http://http//www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_064325)\n\nFurther information\n\nMHRA\n\n[Drug Safety Update](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/drugsafetyupdate) brings you the latest information about changes to prescribing information to support safer use of medicines\n\n[Review of unlicensed medicines](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Reviewofunlicensedmedicines/index.htm)\n\n[Importation of unlicensedÂ medicines](http://http//www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Importingandexportingmedicines/Importingunlicensedmedicines/index.htm)\n\nConsent\n\n[Key documents from the Department of Health](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Scientificdevelopmentgeneticsandbioethics/Consent/Consentgeneralinformation/index.htm)\n\n[British National FormularyBritish National Formulary](http://www.bnf.org.uk/)\n\n[British National Formulary for ChildrenBritish National Formulary for Children](http://www.bnf.org/bnf/org_450055.htm)\n\n[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child HealthRoyal College of Paediatrics and Child Health](http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/)\n\nÂ \n\nArticle citation: Drug Safety Update April 2009, vol 2 issue 9: 6.\n"
