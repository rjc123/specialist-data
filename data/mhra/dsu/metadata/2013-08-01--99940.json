The review confirmed the well known risks of neurological effects such as short-term extrapyramidal disorders and tardive dyskinesia. The conclusion of the review was that these risks outweigh the benefits in long-term or high-dose treatment.\n\nThe EU review has recommended changes that include a restriction to the dose and duration of use to help minimise the risk of potentially serious neurological adverse effects.
