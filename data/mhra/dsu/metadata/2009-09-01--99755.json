These studies assessed the overall risk of cancer in addition to the risk of breast cancer with insulin glargine, compared with risk in other treatment groups (some insulin and some oral therapy). The results of these retrospective observational studies are not entirely consistent, and can neither confirm nor exclude a relationship between insulin glargine and cancer. A summary of the main results is presented in the table below: \n\n## Table: Studies of cancer risk for insulin glargine\n\n   \n  \n |   | Any malignancy, hazard ratio (95% CI) |   | Breast cancer, hazard ratio (95% CI) |   \n-|-  \nHemkens et al8 |   | 1·18 (1·08–1·28)* |   | Not assessed |   \nCurrie et al3 |   | 0·81 (0·59–1·11)† 1·14 (0·84–1·52)‡ |   | 0·86 (0·42–1·75)§ |   \nColhoun et al9 (incident insulin cohort) |   | 0·87 (0·63–1·21)|| |   | 1·47 (0·59–3·64)|| |   \nJonasson et al10 |   | 1·06 (0·90–1·25)|| |   | 1·97 (1·30–3·00)|| | \n\nComparators: *Human insulin alone. †Long-acting human insulin; data derived to ensure consistency of comparators and are not cited in original paper. ‡Biphasic human insulin; data derived to ensure consistency of comparators and are not cited in original paper. §All insulins. ||Non-glargine insulin.\n\nThe four studies3,8,9,10 were relatively short in duration of exposure and observation period to study drug-induced or drug-modified malignances. The mean follow-up for glargine varied from 1·31 years to 2·74 years, whereas the mean follow-up for comparator groups varied from 1·68 years to 3·36 years. A positive association between insulin glargine and any malignancy was found in the study by Hemkens and colleagues8 only after re-analysis of the data for dose-related effects. Jonasson and colleagues10 investigated the incidence of in situ tumours, breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and prostate cancer and found a positive association with use of insulin glargine alone and breast cancer.\n\nMethodological problems identified in these studies included potential exposure misclassification, selection bias, differing choice of comparator group, adjustment for confounding factors, and incomplete information on risk factors. Although the studies controlled for some confounding factors such as age and smoking, most known risk factors for breast cancer (ie, age at menopause, parity, exogenous hormone use, genetic predisposition or family history, body-mass index, and socioeconomic status) were not taken into account in most of the analyses.\n\n## Randomised controlled trials\n\nA post-hoc analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial[^10] is more reassuring. This relatively small 5-year trial compared the risk of diabetic retinopathy in patients receiving insulin glargine or NPH insulin; cancer risk was a secondary outcome. 514 patients received insulin glargine and 503 patients received NPH. Three (0·6%) patients in the insulin glargine group developed breast cancer versus five (1%) patients in the NPH group. \n\nAdvice from the European Medicines Agency\n\nAfter a review of the available preclinical and clinical data, the European Medicines Agency has advised that no change in recommendations for use is required at present, and patients being treated with insulin glargine can continue their treatment. However, further research is needed in this area.\n\n##  \n\n## Further review and research\n\nA range of options for further research on this issue is being considered. There is a large ongoing randomised controlled trial (called ORIGIN, Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention), which may provide additional useful information on this issue.\n\n## Further information\n\n[European Medicines Agency update on safety of insulin glargine](http://www.ema.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/Lantus/47063209en.pdf)\n\n[Insulin glargine and possible cancer link](http://www.npci.org.uk/blog/?p=374) (National Prescribing Centre)\n\n[Diabetes UK](http://www.diabetes.org.uk/) website\n\n \n\nArticle citation: Drug Safety Update Sept 2009, vol 3 issue 2: 3.\n\n[^1]: Evans JM, et al.
