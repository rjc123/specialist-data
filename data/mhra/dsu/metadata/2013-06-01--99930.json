To further improve the benefit-risk balance some important changes have been made to clarify the indication&#8212;these are discussed below. Although the indications for co-cyprindiol relate to androgen-sensitive skin conditions and hirsuitism, the medicine also provides effective contraception for women who require it.

A review of the benefits and risks of co-cyprindiol was initiated in January 2013 following concerns in France about the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and off-label use as a contraceptive. The review has concluded that the balance of benefits and risks of co-cyprindiol remains positive; however, some important changes to product information for prescribers and women have been made to further improve this balance.</p>\n\n<h3>New information wording</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Indication for use</strong></p>\n\n<p>The review considered the available data on the safety and efficacy of co-cyprindiol and concluded that it should be used in women of reproductive age for the treatment of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>skin conditions related to androgen sensitivity, such as severe acne with or without seborrhoea</li>\n\n<li>hirsutism</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Co-cyprindiol should only be used when treatment with topical therapy or systemic antibiotics has failed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contraceptive action</strong></p>\n\n<p>Co-cyprindiol provides effective contraception in women who require it to treat androgen-sensitive conditions, but it should not be used solely as a contraceptive.</p>\n\n<p>Review of postmarketing data for adverse drug reactions has suggested that some women are using Dianette as well as a combined hormonal contraceptive.

The available observational data have limitations, but taken together their findings provide sufficient evidence that co-cyprindiol has a 1.5&#8211;2 times statistically significant increase in VTE risk (deep vein thrombosis, DVT, or pulmonary embolism, PE) compared with levonorgestrel-containing pills.
