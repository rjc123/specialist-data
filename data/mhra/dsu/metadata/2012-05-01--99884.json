The strategy’s objective is to ensure significant improvements in dementia services across three key areas: improved awareness; earlier diagnosis and intervention; and a higher quality of care. \n\nThe government commissioned the Banerjee Report (Time for Action, an independent review of the use of antipsychotics in elderly people with dementia) as part of the strategy[^2].
