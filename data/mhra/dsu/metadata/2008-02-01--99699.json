In this regard, biosimilars are different to the more familiar generic products. Examples of biosimilar products include:  \n  \nReference product (substance) |   | Biosimilar products |   \n-|-  \nGenotropin (somatropin), |   | Valtropin, Omnitrope |   \nEprex (epoetin alpha) |   | Binocrit (epoetin alpha) |   \nEprex (epoetin alpha) |   | Retacrit (epoetin zeta) | \n\n## Prescribing of biosimilars\n\nAll biosimilar products are prescription only medicines (POM). When prescribing biological products, it is good practice to use the brand name. This will ensure that automatic substitution of a biosimilar product does not occur when the medicine is dispensed by the pharmacist. Products (biosimilar and reference) that have the same international non-proprietary name (INN) are not to be presumed identical for the reasons given above.\n\n## Reporting suspected ADRs for biosimilars\n\nIn view of the subtle differences that are likely to exist between biosimilar products, even though the clinical effect of the products may be similar, and in view of the complexity of these molecules, it is very important that adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are properly assigned to the suspect product. Particular care needs to be taken when reporting ADRs associated with biosimilar products.\n\nTo ensure that any ADR that you report is assigned to the correct product, it is important that the product name rather than the substance name is used for reporting.
