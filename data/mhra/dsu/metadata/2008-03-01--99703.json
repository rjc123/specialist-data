  "body": "Article date: March 2008\n\nTazocin (piperacillin/tazobactam) is used to treat a wide range of infections. Because of changes to the European Pharmacopoeia, the medicine has been reformulated and now has two additional excipients: edetate disodium dihydrate (EDTA) and citric acid.\n\nThese additional excipients have improved the physical compatibility of the medicine. The new formulation of Tazocin is now compatible with lactated Ringer’s (Hartmann’s) solution and, in some circumstances, with aminoglycosides. Although generally the mixing of beta-lactam antibiotics with aminoglycosides can inactivate the aminoglycoside, amikacin and gentamicin are compatible with reformulated Tazocin at specific concentrations.\n\nThe addition of EDTA to Tazocin has increased the amount of sodium in the product, which equates to a sodium load of 5·58 mEq (128 mg) per 2·25 g dose of Tazocin and 11·16 mEq (256 mg) sodium per 4·5 g dose of Tazocin.\n\nThe new formulation is being launched in March 2008. The Marketing Authorisation holder, Wyeth, is taking steps to minimise the amount of time the two formulations are in the supply chain concurrently.
