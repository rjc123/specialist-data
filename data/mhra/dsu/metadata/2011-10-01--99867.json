Various buccal midazolam preparations have been used in children as unlicensed medicines, including Buccolam prior to authorisation.\n\nSeveral factors should be considered when transferring patients to the authorised Buccolam product when an unlicensed medicine other than Buccolam has been used previously.\n\nBuccolam is half the strength of some other unlicensed preparations.
