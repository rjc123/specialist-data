  "body": "Article date: June 2013\n\nHydroxyethyl starch (HES) products are synthetic colloid solutions used for plasma volume expansion in a range of clinical settings. In the UK, marketed HES products are: Volulyte; Tetraspan; Venofundin; and Voluven.\n\nLarge randomised clinical trials have reported an increased risk of renal dysfunction and mortality over a 90-day follow-up in patients who received HES compared with crystalloids. Increased risk of renal dysfunction has been shown in trials of patients with sepsis[^1] [^2] and in a large trial of critically ill patients, including a subgroup with sepsis. [^3] Increased mortality at 90 days was also shown in the trials of patients with sepsis. 1,2\n\nThe most accurate estimate of the magnitude of these risks is from meta-analyses of published data. A meta-analysis published in JAMA reported an increased relative risk of renal failure of 1•27 (95%CI 1•09–1•47) for HES compared with crystalloid.[^4] A Cochrane review that included 25 studies with mortality data reported an increased relative mortality risk of 1•10 (95%CI 1•02–1•19) for HES compared with crystalloid. [^5]\n\nThe EU Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has reviewed the balance of benefits and risks of HES products in different patient groups. The review concluded that there is a clear indication of harm when HES is used for fluid resuscitation, and no evidence of a greater benefit, compared with crystalloid solutions. The risks HES products pose to patients are considered to outweigh the benefits in all clinical settings.
