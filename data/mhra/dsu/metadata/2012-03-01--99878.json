Although less evidence is available for other patient groups, adverse outcomes cannot be excluded and therefore the combination is not recommended for any patient.</p>\n\n<h2>Severe renal impairment</h2>\n\n<p>In addition, prescribers should note that use of aliskiren is no longer recommended in any patient with severe renal impairment&#8212;ie, an eGFR &#60;30 mL/min per 1.73m<span class=\"super\">2</span>, irrespective of whether it is used in combination with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, another antihypertensive, or as monotherapy.
