  "body": "Article date: June 2013\n\nThe use of codeine for analgesia in children and adolescents under 18 has been restricted after a European safety review. The review was triggered by case reports of children who received codeine for pain control after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy (or both) for obstructive sleep apnoea and who developed rare, but life-threatening adverse events, including death.\n\nCodeine is converted to morphine in the liver by the CYP2D6 enzyme. There are many genetic variations of CYP2D6, which affect the extent of this conversion in individuals. Different plasma morphine concentrations in patients’ blood leads not only to different levels of pain relief, but also to a variable and unpredictable risk of side effects due to morphine’s action on the brain and respiratory centre.\n\nAdvice for healthcare professionals:  \n  \n  * Codeine should only be used to relieve acute moderate pain in children older than 12 years and only if it cannot be relieved by other painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen alone  \n  * Codeine is now contraindicated in:   \n    * all children age 0–18 years who undergo tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy (or both) for obstructive sleep apnoea  \n    * all patients of any age known to be CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolisers  \n  * Codeine is not recommended for use in children whose breathing might be compromised, including those with: neuromuscular disorders; severe cardiac or respiratory conditions; upper respiratory or lung infections; multiple trauma; or extensive surgical procedures.
