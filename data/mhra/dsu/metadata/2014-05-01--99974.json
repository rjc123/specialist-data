The gene <em>SLCO1B1</em> encodes for OATP1B1, one of a family of uptake transporters which controls statin uptake from the blood into liver cells. Simvastatin is primarily taken up via the OATP1B1 transporter. Other statins are taken up by additional or different transporters, so the blood plasma concentration of those statins is less susceptible to changes in OATP1B1 function than that of simvastatin (see table). Inherited variations in the <em>SLCO1B1</em> gene affect the ability of this transporter to metabolise statins. People can be grouped into one of three statin-metabolising genotypes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>normal metabolisers of statins (those who carry two copies of the standard gene, or T/T)</li>\n\n<li>intermediate metabolisers (those who carry one copy of the standard and one copy of the variant gene, or T/C)</li>\n\n<li>poor metabolisers (those who carry two copies of the variant gene, or C/C).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>People who are poor metabolisers (C/C) have reduced OATP1B1 transporter function and experience higher blood plasma levels of simvastatin for the same administered dose compared with normal metabolisers (T/T) or intermediate metabolisers (T/C). As a consequence people who carry a C variant gene are at higher risk of developing myopathy with simvastatin (especially if they have two copies of it) than people who carry a T variant.</p>\n\n<p>Where a person&#8217;s <em>SLCO1B1</em> genotype is known or can be tested, this should be taken into consideration before prescribing high doses of simvastatin. As a test is not yet readily available in the UK, alternative statins which are less affected by this genetic subtype should be considered (see table).

The statins currently available in the UK are simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin.\n\nEvidence from large clinical trials[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] shows that statins can reduce heart attacks and the need for bypass surgery, and can save lives in certain patient groups.

Although they may be distressing to the individual concerned and limit that individual’s willingness or ability to tolerate statin use, statin-related side effects are generally mild and not medically serious.\n\nMuscle-related problems are the most frequently reported side effect of statins. The following statin side effect incidences have been estimated based on randomised trial data, cohort studies, published case reports and spontaneous reports:[^5]  \n  \n  * mild muscle pain: 190 cases per 100,000 patient years  \n  * myopathy: 5 cases per 100,000 patient years  \n  * rhabdomyolysis: 1.6 cases per 100,000 patient years  \n  \nRecent studies from electronic medical record databases[^6] [^7] have found similar rates.

Myopathy risk also increases when certain medicines are used together with statins, either because both medicines can cause myopathy or because the second medicine increases the blood plasma concentration of the statin (mimicking the effects of a higher statin dose). The [prescribing information and patient leaflets](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Medicinesinformation/SPCandPILs/index.htm) for each statin advises on how to minimise the risk of side effects, including:  \n  \n  * which medicines to avoid taking with statins  \n  * when to use a lower statin dose  \n  * when to interrupt or stop statin treatment.  \n  \nFor further information see the [Drug Safety Update article on interactions](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON180637) and the [article for patients taking simvastatin](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Safetywarningsalertsandrecalls/Safetywarningsandmessagesformedicines/CON199556).\n\nCertain genetic profiles may increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy\n\nRecent studies6 [^8] have highlighted that some people’s genetic make-up may make them more prone to experiencing myopathy while taking certain statins. The gene SLCO1B1 encodes for OATP1B1, one of a family of uptake transporters which controls statin uptake from the blood into liver cells. Simvastatin is primarily taken up via the OATP1B1 transporter. Other statins are taken up by additional or different transporters, so the blood plasma concentration of those statins is less susceptible to changes in OATP1B1 function than that of simvastatin (see table). Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene affect the ability of this transporter to metabolise statins. People can be grouped into one of three statin-metabolising genotypes:  \n  \n  * normal metabolisers of statins (those who carry two copies of the standard gene, or T/T)  \n  * intermediate metabolisers (those who carry one copy of the standard and one copy of the variant gene, or T/C)  \n  * poor metabolisers (those who carry two copies of the variant gene, or C/C).  \n  \nPeople who are poor metabolisers (C/C) have reduced OATP1B1 transporter function and experience higher blood plasma levels of simvastatin for the same administered dose compared with normal metabolisers (T/T) or intermediate metabolisers (T/C). As a consequence people who carry a C variant gene are at higher risk of developing myopathy with simvastatin (especially if they have two copies of it) than people who carry a T variant.\n\nWhere a person’s SLCO1B1 genotype is known or can be tested, this should be taken into consideration before prescribing high doses of simvastatin. As a test is not yet readily available in the UK, alternative statins which are less affected by this genetic subtype should be considered (see table). There is no need for anyone who has been using simvastatin without any problems to stop taking it on the basis of this information.\n\nTable: Effect of SLCO1B1 genotypes on the systemic exposure of various statins[^9]  \n  \n   |   |  Percentage increase in AUC for SLCO1B1 CC versus SLCO1B1 TT  |   \nSimvastatin  |   |  221%  |   \nPitavastatin  |   |  162–191%  |   \nAtorvastatin  |   |  144%  |   \nPravastatin  |   |  57–130%  |   \nRosuvastatin  |   |  62–117%  |   \nFluvastatin  |   |  19% (non-significant)  | \n\nAUC = area under the plasma concentration-time curve\n\nThings to consider when prescribing statins\n\nAdvise patients to seek prompt medical attention if they experience muscle problems while taking statins. Myopathy may not be clinically serious to start with, but can rarely progress to potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis. Review statin treatment if muscle problems occur. For some patients, stopping statin treatment may be appropriate. If statin treatment must be continued despite muscle problems, consider using a lower statin dose or switching to a different statin. Take into account the severity of the myopathy, the degree of hypercholesterolaemia, and the patient’s medical history.\n\nPatients and prescribers should also be aware that other side effects have also been reported in association with statins.[^10] [^11] These are listed in the [summary of product characteristics and patient information leaflet](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Medicinesinformation/SPCandPILs/index.htm) of each statin.\n\nThe benefits of using any statin in its licensed indication outweigh the risks in most patients. As with all medicines, the MHRA constantly reviews the safety of statins and will inform prescribers and patients when new important information becomes available. In deciding whether to offer statin therapy, carefully consider both the potential benefits and harms for each patient.\n\nArticle citation: Drug Safety Update volume 7 issue 10, May 2014: H1.\n\n[^1]: Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaborators.
