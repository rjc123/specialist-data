  "body": "Article date: April 2010\n\nParenteral amphotericin B is available as lipid-based and non-lipid-based formulations for the treatment of fungal infections. These different formulations of amphotericin B have different dose requirements.\n\nCases of fatal overdose have resulted when Fungizone (a non-lipid-based formulation of amphotericin B) has been mistakenly administered instead of a lipid-based formulation. Amphotericin B overdoses may result in potentially fatal cardiac or cardiorespiratory arrest. The total daily dose of Fungizone should not exceed 1·5 mg/kg.\n\nThe appropriate dose and method of administration differ markedly between the marketed parenteral formulations of amphotericin B and they are therefore not interchangeable.\n\nParticular care must be taken in prescribing and dispensing the correct parenteral formulation of amphotericin B: prescribers, pharmacists, and nurses need to be fully aware of the formulation being used and the associated dose regimen.\n\nFungizone packages, cartons, and vial labels are being modified to carry the following cautionary statements: “Fungizone is not interchangeable with other amphotericin products.
