  "body": "Article date: February 2008\n\n## Carisoprodol\n\nCarisoprodol (Carisoma) is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used in the short term as an adjunct to the symptomatic treatment of acute musculoskeletal disorders associated with painful muscle spasm.\n\nIn the [January 2008 issue of Drug Safety Update, a Stop press article](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/ssLINK/CON084711) announced the recent European review of carisoprodol for which the [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/about_us/general/general_content_000094.jsp&jsenabled=true) (CHMP) concluded that the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. This review was triggered by concerns from the Norwegian Medical Agency that carisoprodol was associated with increased risk of abuse, addiction, intoxication, and psychomotor impairment.\n\nThe CHMP has recommended that all Marketing Authorisations for carisoprodol-containing products should be suspended throughout the European Union. It is anticipated that a decision by the European Commission to ratify the CHMP decision will follow in the near future. A key feature of the CHMP opinion is that there are safer alternatives to carisoprodol for the management of acute musculoskeletal disorders where a muscle relaxant is required; one such alternative is a benzodiazepine.\n\nEvidence suggests that carisoprodol can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome.[^1] Clinical features include anxiety, insomnia, muscle twitching, and hallucinations, and are thought to be due to withdrawal of meprobamate—the main active metabolite of carisoprodol. When a patient may be physically dependent on carisoprodol, a gradual decrease in dose is required (which might take several weeks for those on high doses). If a withdrawal syndrome occurs, benzodiazepines are recommended in the short term; antipsychotics and antidepressants have also been used. \n\nThe MHRA is working with the UK Marketing Authorisation Holder (Forest Laboratories UK Ltd) to achieve a planned withdrawal of carisoprodol from the UK market. The European Commission’s decision may be issued before complete withdrawal of carisoprodol in the UK (particularly because there are patients who are physically dependent on the medicine). In these circumstances, essential supply will be possible on a named patient basis.\n\nAdvice for healthcare professionals:  \n  \n  * The UK Marketing Authorisation for carisoprodol is to be suspended  \n  * Treatment with carisoprodol should not be started  \n  * Carisoprodol is associated with a withdrawal syndrome  \n  * When a patient may be physically dependent on carisoprodol, a gradual decrease in dose is required (which might take several weeks for those on high doses)  \n  * Carisoprodol should not be stopped suddenly  \n  * If a withdrawal syndrome occurs, benzodiazepines are recommended in the short term; antipsychotics and antidepressants have also been used  \n  \n## Meprobamate\n\nMeprobamate is a carbamate used for short-term treatment of anxiety states or musculoskeletal disorders where, in either case, there is muscle tension or painful muscle spasm.\n\nMeprobamate shares many of the risks associated with barbiturates, including dependence and withdrawal, and has therefore been mainly superseded by relatively safer medicines.
