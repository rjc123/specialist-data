  "body": "Article date: November 2009\n\nIndividual bisphosphonates have different indications, and are used for: prophylaxis and treatment of osteoporosis; treatment of Paget’s disease; and as part of some cancer regimens, particularly for metastatic bone cancer and multiple myeloma.\n\nA Europe-wide review has been completed on the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in association with the use of bisphosphonates. The review included data from the published literature and data provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holders (including data from experimental and preclinical studies, clinical trials, and post-marketing reports) and guidelines produced by learned societies. The review also incorporated advice from a group of experts representing all areas of medicine where bisphosphonates are used, dentistry and bone surgery, and representatives of patients’ organisations.\n\nUp to Oct 26, 2009, the majority of UK Yellow Card reports of ONJ have been in patients treated with zoledronate (172 reports). Yellow Card reports of ONJ have also been received in association with alendronate (47 reports), pamidronate (38 reports), ibandronate (28 reports), clodronate (12 reports), and risedronate (11 reports). It is very important to remember that the number of reports for a particular bisphosphonate cannot be used to determine the incidence of ONJ for each individual drug because neither the total number of reactions occurring nor the number of patients using the drug is known.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) reached conclusions on the currently available evidence on four main areas: definition and diagnosis of ONJ related to bisphosphonates; possible underlying pathophysiological mechanism(s); risk stratification; and risk minimisation. The key messages for healthcare professionals from this review are given below.\n\nAdvice for healthcare professionals:  \n  \n  * The risk of developing ONJ in association with oral bisphosphonates seems to be low. The risk of ONJ is substantially greater for patients receiving intravenous bisphosphonates for cancer indications than for patients receiving oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis or Paget’s disease  \n  * There is clear evidence to suggest bisphosphonate-specific and indication-specific risk factors such as potency (highest for zoledronate); route of administration (eg, intravenous ibandronte, pamidronate, and zoledronate); and cumulative dose.
