Both the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee have concluded that the benefits no longer outweigh the risks.\n\nOur information from the European Medicines Agency indicates that one parallel-distributor, Swingward Ltd T/A Medihealth has registered as a parallel-distributor. Both originator and parallel-distributed stock is in the supply-chain and will need to be handled differently as outlined below.\n\nNo further Tredaptive tablets should be dispensed. Pharmacists should refer patients with new or repeat prescriptions to the treating physician to review their treatment plan on a non-urgent basis.\n\nAny remaining stock of this product should be quarantined, identified as originator or parallel-distributed stock and returned to the original supplier in the normal way.\n\nFor enquiries relating to stock returns, with originator product: If you purchased Tredaptive from Alliance Healthcare Distribution Limited, they will be in contact with you shortly with details of the recall procedure. Should you have any questions, please contact your local Alliance Service Centre. If you did not purchase Tredaptive from Alliance, you should contact your supplier to arrange return.\n\nFor enquiries relating to stock returns, with parallel-distributed Swingward/Medihealth stock please call Ms Brenda Greenwood on 01204 473136.\n\nFor all medical information enquiries, please call MSD Medical Information department on 01992 467272.\n\nRecipients of this Drug Alert should bring it to the attention of relevant contacts by copy of this letter.
