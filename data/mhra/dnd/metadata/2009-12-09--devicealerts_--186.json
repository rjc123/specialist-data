  "body": "## Device\n\nUltrasound transducer probes with an internal lumen used for taking transrectal prostate biopsies.\n\nAll manufacturers.\n\nAll ultrasound transducer probes which require the passing of a biopsy needle through the internal lumen. \n\n## Problem\n\nPotential onward transmission of abnormal prion protein, the putative infective agent in variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (vCJD), when ultrasound transducer probes with an internal lumen are used for taking transrectal prostate biopsies on men at risk of vCJD.\n\nThe needle that passes through the internal lumen of a reusable ultrasound probe could transfer the abnormal prion protein from rectal lymphoid tissue, via the outside surface of the biopsy needle, onto the internal lumen of the ultrasound probe. Any attempt at subsequent decontamination of the internal lumen would not be successful due to the inability of any current decontamination process to reliably eliminate or destroy abnormal prion protein.\n\n## Action\n\nReview the advice given in the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) TSE Working Group\u2019s alert to urological surgeons \u2018[Transrectal prostatic biopsy in men at risk of variant CJD](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@ab/documents/digitalasset/dh_106909.pdf)\u2019 (external link), published on the Department of Health\u2019s website.\n\nThe ACDP TSE Working Group and CJD Incidents Panel advise the following: \u2018Patients at risk of vCJD requiring transrectal prostatic biopsy should have the procedure performed by means of single use equipment that runs alongside (rather than through) the ultrasound probe. Where a unit does not have such equipment and intends to carry out a biopsy procedure on a patient at risk of vCJD, their options are as follows:  \n  \n  * To refer the patient to a unit offering an alternative technique that does not pose a risk of contaminating the internal channels with traces of biopsy tissue  \n  * To borrow the alternative equipment from another unit  \n  * To undertake the procedure with equipment that has internal biopsy channels, and then quarantine the reusable components of that equipment after decontamination. It must be accepted that this equipment would be unlikely to return to general use, except for dedicated re-use in the same patient.\u2019  \n  \nFrom the ACDP TSE Working Group\u2019s alert to urological surgeons:\n\n\u2018The following patient groups have been notified of their increased risk of subclinical vCJD infection:  \n  \n  * people who have received blood from someone who went on to develop vCJD  \n  * people who have given blood to someone who went on to develop vCJD  \n  * people who have received blood from someone who has also given blood to a patient who went on to develop vCJD  \n  * people who have had surgery using instruments that had been used on someone who developed vCJD  \n  * people who have had a neurosurgical procedure, or an operation for a tumour or cyst of the spine, before August 1992  \n  * people who have received an organ or tissue from a donor infected with vCJD or at increased risk of vCJD  \n  * people who have been treated with certain UK sourced plasma products between 1980 and 2001.  \n  \nIt is important to note that new patient groups may be notified in the future of their increased risk of vCJD.\u2019\n\nThe advice in the ACDP\u2019s alert does not apply in procedures on men who are not at risk of vCJD nor to the use of probes that are covered by latex in their entirety while guided prostatic biopsy is being performed via a separate single use external biopsy sheath.\n\n## Distribution\n\nThis MDA has been distributed to:  \n  \n  * NHS trusts in England (Chief Executives)  \n  * Care Quality Commission (CQC) (Headquarters)  \n  * Health Protection Agency (HPA) (Directors)  \n  * HSC trusts in Northern Ireland (Chief Executives)  \n  * NHS boards in Scotland (Chief Executives)  \n  * NHS boards and trusts in Wales (Chief Executives)  \n  * Primary care trusts in England (Chief Executives)  \n  \nOnward distribution  \nPlease bring this notice to the attention of all who need to know or be aware of it.
