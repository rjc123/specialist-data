New contraindications and changes in posology were also introduced following evidence of a small increased risk of serious cardiac side effects (eg, QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, serious ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death).\u00a0 The MHRA communicated the new recommendations to healthcare professionals on 25th April 2014.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe European review recommended that medical intervention is likely to be needed to identify patients suitable for treatment with domperidone.\u00a0\u00a0 Taking account of the new recommendations, contraindications and warnings now in place to minimise the small risk of serious cardiac effects, the CHM concluded that domperidone is no longer suitable for supply without prescription.\n\nAdvice for healthcare professionals  \n  \n  * Domperidone must not be sold without prescription  \n  * Non-prescription domperidone products (Motilium 10 and Motilium instants) are being recalled  \n  * The updated prescription advice should be taken into consideration before prescribing domperidone (see MHRA Drug Safety Update article from May 2014: <http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON418518>)  \n  \nAdvice to give to patients  \n  \n  * If you have recently bought domperidone without a prescription and you wish to continue taking it, speak to your doctor or pharmacist at your next routine visit.\u00a0 There is no problem if you wish to stop and a healthcare professional can advise on suitable alternatives for nausea and vomiting.  \n  * If you have been prescribed domperidone, there is no need to stop taking it. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist at your next routine visit if you have any heart problems or other concerns about the treatment.  \n  * Talk to a doctor straight away if you experience dizziness; fainting; chest pain; or a rapid, fluttering, or pounding heartbeat while taking domperidone.  \n  \nReporting side effects\n\nPlease report any suspected side effects to any medicine or vaccine to the Yellow Card Scheme via the website ([www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)) or by calling the free phone line (0800 731 6789). By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of medicines.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr Sarah Branch  \nDeputy Director  \nVigilance and Risk management of Medicines Division  \nMHRA  \nTelephone: 0203 080 6373  \nEmail: sarah.branch@mhra.gsi.gov.uk\n\n\u00a0\n\nMHRA Distribution (further recipients by cascade):  N/A \n\n### Download documents:  \n  \n  * [ASSET_TAG](#ASSET0)\n",
