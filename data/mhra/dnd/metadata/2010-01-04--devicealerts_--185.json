  "body": "## Device\n\nMedical devices in general and non-medical products. \n\n## Problem  \n  \n  * Off-label use of medical devices.  \n  * User modifications of devices other than directed by the device manufacturer.  \n  * Use of products, other than those that are CE-marked as medical devices, for clinical purposes.  \n  \nThe Medical Devices Regulations (that implement the relative Directive) stipulate that the manufacturer of a device is responsible for establishing that the device is safe and that it is suitable for its intended purpose. To establish this, manufacturers implement appropriate controls on the device design and manufacture, and evaluate the safety and performance of the device in its intended application. This involves an analysis of risks that could arise during use, an assessment of relevant pre-clinical and clinical data, the preparation of appropriate instructions for use and, if necessary, specific training schemes. From such activities, manufacturers are able to verify that risks have been eliminated or minimised and are judged acceptable when weighed against the anticipated benefits to patients.\n\nTherefore devices that are:  \n  \n  * used off-label (eg [foley catheters as enteral feeding tubes - One Liners Issue 35 - July 2005](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/ssLINK/CON1004209))  \n  * modified by the user (eg loading of an anaesthetic workstation beyond its specified capacity leading to the device overbalancing, or, reconfiguration of a Bain\u2019s breathing system, resulting in the wrong size oxygen connector being used and thus ventilation hindered)  \n  * not intended for medical use (eg pillows or blankets used to position patients during MRI, leading to patient burns, or non-medical LED torches used for patient neurological observations, when the packaging warns against shining the torch into a person\u2019s eyes)  \n  \nwill not have undergone this level of scrutiny. The consequent lack of verification of device performance means that it cannot be assured to be safe, suitable or effective. The use of a device in these circumstances exposes users and patients to unknown and therefore unacceptable risks and may have legal and ethical implications.\n\nExamples of potential dangers include:  \n  \n  * adverse reactions  \n  * inadequate sterilization  \n  * insufficient mechanical strength and/or structural integrity  \n  * insufficient durability  \n  * misuse due to lack of adequate training for device.  \n  \nAs well as the risks to the patient and user, liability for the performance and safety of products that have been modified, adapted or used off-label, could be transferred to the user. Healthcare professionals should also be aware that following modification of a CE-marked medical device, the healthcare organisation and/or professional could be deemed to be the manufacturer of a new device and may therefore be subject to the requirements of the Medical Devices Regulations.\n\nThe consequences of using even simple medical devices outside their intended purpose can be serious. For example [use of tongue depressors (Class I medical devices) in a neonatal ITU (One Liners Issue 1 - May\u00a01997)](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/ssLINK/CON007420)\u00a0as limb splints led to two deaths and one amputation because of fungal infection. The MHRA has also issued [advice on the risk of entrapment and asphyxiation of people in beds used with incompatible side rails\u00a0(DB 2006(06) Safe use of bed rails](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/ssLINK/CON2025348)).\n\n## Action\n\nEnsure users are aware of the risks associated with and, where possible, avoid:  \n  \n  * the off-label use of medical devices  \n  * the modification of medical devices (unless such modifications are sanctioned in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use)  \n  * the use of products other than those CE-marked as medical devices in clinical settings, particularly when CE-marked medical devices that are specifically designed and manufactured to be used for that clinical purpose are available.  \n  \n\u00a0  \n  \n  * Ensure that you are familiar with the instructions for use including the intended purposes for all the devices you use.  \n  * Only use devices for their intended purpose; do not modify or alter the function or structure of medical devices unless specifically sanctioned by the instructions for use.  \n  * Do not use modified medical devices or non-medical products for clinical purposes unless there is no suitable CE-marked alternative.  \n  * Where the healthcare organisation or healthcare professional judges that there is no alternative but to use a medical device off-label or modify an existing medical or non CE-marked medical device:  \n  *     * carry out and document a risk assessment  \n    * consider the ethical and legal implications  \n    * implement suitable precautions to minimize the risk  \n    * review the risk assessment at suitable periods.  \n  * Where a healthcare professional judges there is no alternative to off-label device use, the patient must be fully informed during the consent procedure and a note made in the patient's records.  \n  \nThis notice updates and replaces MDA/2004/006.\n\n## Distribution\n\nThis MDA has been distributed to:  \n  \n  * NHS trusts in England (Chief Executives)  \n  * Care Quality Commission (CQC) (Headquarters)  \n  * Health Protection Agency (HPA) (Directors)  \n  * HSC trusts in Northern Ireland (Chief Executives)  \n  * NHS boards in Scotland (Chief Executives)  \n  * NHS boards and trusts in Wales (Chief Executives)  \n  * OFSTED  \n  * Primary care trusts in England (Chief Executives)  \n  * Social services in England (Directors)  \n  \nOnward distribution  \nPlease bring this notice to the attention of all who need to know or be aware of it.
